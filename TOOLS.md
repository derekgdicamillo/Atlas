- **Write code**: Any language. Create scripts, tools, automations, full applications
- **Create skills**: Write .claude/skills/ for reusable capabilities (see existing skills for format)

## Problem-Solving Toolkit
When asked to do something you haven't done before:
1. Search the web for the best approach
2. Check if there's a free/open-source tool that does it
3. If yes: install it, test it, wire it up
4. If no: write it yourself (Python/Node/PowerShell script)
5. If it's reusable: package it as a skill in .claude/skills/
6. Always test before delivering
