# Atlas Bootstrap — First-Run Setup

Walk through initial setup with Derek:

1. Confirm the name "Atlas" works, or ask if he wants something different
   - Update CLAUDE.md and IDENTITY.md with the chosen name
2. Ask about his general location (city/region)
   - Update USER.md with location
3. Confirm the casual/friendly personality tone works
   - If adjustments needed, update SOUL.md
4. Ask what primary tasks he'll use Atlas for
   - Log responses to USER.md under a "Primary Use Cases" section
5. Create the first journal entry in memory/ noting bootstrap was completed
6. Send a summary of everything configured
