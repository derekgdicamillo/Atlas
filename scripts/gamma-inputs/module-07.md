# Lesson 7.1 — Type 2 Diabetes: Dual Benefit & Medication Adjustments

## Learner level
- Provider managing patients with obesity and T2DM
- Integration of diabetes and obesity care

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Explain why GLP-1 RAs are ideal for patients with obesity + T2DM
2. Reduce insulin and sulfonylurea doses appropriately when initiating therapy
3. Choose between Wegovy/Zepbound vs Ozempic/Mounjaro based on clinical goals

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has a BMI of 35 and an A1c of 8.5% on metformin and glipizide. Starting a GLP-1 RA could address both — but what adjustments do you need to make?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Medication overview
- Lesson 5.5: Hypoglycemia risk

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Dual benefit: weight loss + glycemic control
- GLP-1 RAs improve both obesity and T2DM
- Tirzepatide in SURMOUNT-2 (obesity + T2DM): -14.7% weight loss + A1c reduction
- SELECT trial (semaglutide): 20% CV risk reduction
- Ideal for patients where both conditions are treatment targets

### Chunk 2 — Medication adjustments to prevent hypoglycemia
**High-risk combinations:**
- GLP-1 RA + insulin
- GLP-1 RA + sulfonylurea (glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride)

**Recommendations:**
| Concurrent med | Adjustment when starting GLP-1 RA |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Insulin | Reduce basal by 20-25%; reduce bolus more aggressively |
| Sulfonylurea | Reduce by 50% or discontinue |
| Metformin | Usually continue unchanged |
| SGLT2 inhibitor | Usually continue (complementary mechanisms) |
| DPP-4 inhibitor | Discontinue (overlapping mechanism) |

**Monitor closely and adjust further based on glucose readings**

### Chunk 3 — Product selection: obesity vs diabetes indication
| Goal | Product choice | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Primary obesity treatment | Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg) or Zepbound (tirzepatide) | Higher max doses; obesity coverage |
| Primary T2DM treatment | Ozempic (semaglutide) or Mounjaro (tirzepatide) | Diabetes coverage; lower semaglutide max dose |
| Both obesity + T2DM | Either — depends on insurance, patient goals | Some use Mounjaro 15 mg for both |

**Insurance considerations:**
- Obesity-indication products may not be covered by diabetes benefit
- T2DM diagnosis may enable coverage of diabetes product
- Document both diagnoses when applicable

### Chunk 4 — Monitoring in T2DM patients
- Check A1c at baseline, 3 months, 6 months
- If rapid A1c drop (>1.5% in 3 months), proactively reduce insulin/SU
- Consider CGM for high-risk patients
- Watch for retinopathy early worsening (rare) — ophthalmology referral if severe/proliferative DR

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Diabetes medication adjustments
- Flowchart: Product selection for obesity + T2DM

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "GLP-1 RAs are the ideal choice for patients with both obesity and T2DM"
- Anticipate hypoglycemia — reduce insulin/SU proactively, don't wait for episodes
- DPP-4 inhibitors should be stopped (redundant mechanism)

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Should you continue a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) when starting a GLP-1 RA?
   - **Answer:** No — discontinue the DPP-4 inhibitor
   - **Rationale:** Overlapping incretin mechanism; no additive benefit and potential for unnecessary cost
   - **Source:** ADA guidelines

2. **Question:** How much should basal insulin be reduced when initiating GLP-1 RA therapy?
   - **Answer:** Approximately 20-25%
   - **Rationale:** GLP-1 RA will improve glycemia; maintaining full insulin dose risks hypoglycemia
   - **Source:** Clinical practice; ADA Standards of Care

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- GLP-1 RAs provide dual benefit for patients with obesity + T2DM (weight loss + A1c reduction)
- Reduce insulin by 20-25% and reduce/stop sulfonylureas when initiating therapy
- Choose product based on primary treatment goal and insurance coverage

- ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes 2024.
- SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide in obesity + T2DM).
- SELECT trial (semaglutide CV outcomes).

# Lesson 7.2 — Renal Impairment

## Learner level
- Provider treating patients with CKD
- Safety-focused

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State whether dose adjustment is needed for semaglutide and tirzepatide in renal impairment
2. Identify risks for patients with severe CKD
3. Counsel patients on hydration and dehydration risks

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has CKD stage 3b (eGFR 38) and obesity. Can you prescribe Zepbound? What precautions do you need?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 03: Precautions

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Pharmacokinetics in renal impairment
**Semaglutide:**
- No dose adjustment required for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment
- Limited data in ESRD/dialysis — use caution
- Not significantly removed by dialysis

**Tirzepatide:**
- No dose adjustment required for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment
- Limited data in ESRD/dialysis — use caution

**Why no adjustment:**
- GLP-1 RAs are peptides degraded systemically, not renally eliminated
- Renal function doesn't significantly alter drug levels

### Chunk 2 — Risks in renal impairment
**Dehydration risk:**
- GI adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) → fluid loss
- Patients with CKD have less renal reserve to handle dehydration
- Dehydration can worsen renal function (AKI on CKD)

**Post-marketing reports:**
- Cases of AKI reported, usually associated with GI AEs causing dehydration
- FDA label includes warning about renal function monitoring

### Chunk 3 — Practical guidance
**CKD stage 1-3 (eGFR ≥30):**
- No dose adjustment
- Standard titration
- Emphasize hydration counseling

**CKD stage 4-5 (eGFR <30), not on dialysis:**
- No dose adjustment per label
- Extra caution with titration
- Monitor renal function more frequently (every 3 months)
- Aggressive hydration counseling
- Lower threshold to hold for GI AEs

**ESRD/dialysis:**
- Limited data
- Use with caution; consider risk-benefit carefully
- If used, slow titration and close monitoring

### Chunk 4 — Monitoring recommendations
- Baseline: CMP (BUN/Cr, eGFR)
- During titration: recheck if GI symptoms significant
- Maintenance: CMP every 3-6 months (or more frequently in CKD 4-5)
- Educate patient: report decreased urine output, dark urine, dizziness

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: GLP-1 RA use by CKD stage
- Patient handout: Hydration tips for kidney patients on GLP-1 RAs

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "No dose adjustment needed" doesn't mean "no precautions needed"
- Hydration is critical — GI AEs can cause dangerous dehydration in CKD
- If creatinine rises during therapy, check hydration status first

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Is dose adjustment of tirzepatide required in CKD stage 4?
   - **Answer:** No — but use with caution and monitor closely
   - **Rationale:** Pharmacokinetics unchanged, but dehydration risk higher
   - **Source:** FDA prescribing information

2. **Question:** What is the primary renal risk with GLP-1 RAs?
   - **Answer:** AKI from dehydration due to GI adverse effects
   - **Rationale:** GI symptoms → fluid loss → renal hypoperfusion
   - **Source:** FDA warnings; post-marketing data

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- No dose adjustment needed for semaglutide or tirzepatide in renal impairment
- Main risk: dehydration from GI AEs leading to AKI — hydration counseling is critical
- Monitor renal function more frequently in CKD stage 4-5; use caution in ESRD

## Sources
- Wegovy, Ozempic, Zepbound, Mounjaro prescribing information.
- FDA post-marketing safety data.

# Lesson 7.3 — Hepatic Impairment & NAFLD/NASH

## Learner level
- Provider treating patients with liver disease
- Opportunity for disease modification

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State prescribing considerations in hepatic impairment
2. Describe evidence for GLP-1 RAs in NAFLD/NASH improvement
3. Monitor liver enzymes and interpret changes during therapy

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has NAFLD with elevated ALT and BMI 34. GLP-1 therapy might be exactly what they need — but what should you know?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 03: Precautions

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Pharmacokinetics in hepatic impairment
**Semaglutide & Tirzepatide:**
- No dose adjustment required for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A/B/C)
- Limited clinical experience in severe impairment
- Use caution; start low, titrate slowly in severe hepatic disease

### Chunk 2 — GLP-1 RAs as NAFLD/NASH therapy
**Why beneficial:**
- Weight loss alone improves hepatic steatosis
- GLP-1 RAs may have direct hepatoprotective effects (reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity)

**Evidence:**
- **Semaglutide in NASH (NEJM 2021):** 59% achieved NASH resolution vs 17% placebo
- **Tirzepatide in MASH (NEJM 2024):** Up to 74% achieved MASH resolution at highest dose
- Both showed reduction in liver fat and fibrosis improvement signals

**Current status:**
- GLP-1 RAs not FDA-approved specifically for NASH/MASH (as of 2026)
- However, treating obesity in patients with NAFLD/NASH is appropriate and beneficial

### Chunk 3 — Monitoring liver enzymes
**Baseline:**
- Check ALT, AST (often elevated in NAFLD)

**During therapy:**
- Expect ALT/AST to IMPROVE with weight loss (reassuring sign)
- If ALT rises significantly without other explanation → evaluate (rare)

**Interpreting changes:**
| Pattern | Interpretation | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| ALT decreases | Expected with weight loss/NAFLD improvement | Continue therapy |
| ALT stable | Neutral | Continue, monitor |
| ALT increases | Uncommon; evaluate for other causes | Workup (hepatitis, medications, etc.) |

### Chunk 4 — Practical guidance
**NAFLD/NASH patients:**
- GLP-1 RAs are a preferred AOM choice
- Weight loss + potential direct benefit = dual advantage
- Document NAFLD as comorbidity (supports medical necessity)

**Cirrhosis:**
- Limited data
- No dose adjustment per label, but use caution
- Monitor closely; hepatic metabolism may be altered

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Graph: NASH resolution rates with semaglutide
- Table: Liver enzyme interpretation during therapy

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "GLP-1 RAs are arguably the best AOM choice for patients with NAFLD/NASH"
- Expect liver enzymes to improve — this is a treatment benefit, not coincidence
- Formal NASH indication likely coming — use now for obesity with comorbid NAFLD

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What percent of patients achieved NASH resolution with semaglutide in the phase 2 trial?
   - **Answer:** 59% (vs 17% placebo)
   - **Rationale:** Strong signal for hepatoprotective benefit beyond weight loss
   - **Source:** Newsome PN et al. NEJM 2021

2. **Question:** Should you be concerned if ALT decreases during GLP-1 therapy?
   - **Answer:** No — this is expected and indicates NAFLD improvement
   - **Rationale:** Weight loss reduces hepatic steatosis and inflammation
   - **Source:** Clinical understanding of NAFLD pathophysiology

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- No dose adjustment for hepatic impairment; use caution in severe disease
- GLP-1 RAs show strong evidence for NASH resolution and may receive formal approval
- Expect ALT improvement during therapy — a marker of benefit

# Lesson 7.4 — Older Adults (Geriatric Considerations)

## Learner level
- Provider treating patients ≥65 years
- Risk-benefit nuance

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Recognize unique risks of weight loss in older adults
2. Prioritize lean mass preservation strategies
3. Adjust goals and monitoring for geriatric patients

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your 72-year-old patient wants to try Wegovy for her obesity and knee osteoarthritis. Is the benefit worth the risk of muscle loss?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 06: Progress tracking
- Lesson 6.3: Body composition

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Pharmacokinetics in older adults
- No dose adjustment required based on age alone
- Clinical trials included patients up to 75+ years
- Generally well-tolerated in older adults

**But:** Older adults have different physiology and goals

### Chunk 2 — Unique risks in geriatric patients
**Sarcopenia concerns:**
- Older adults already have age-related muscle loss
- Weight loss → further muscle loss → functional decline, falls
- "Sarcopenic obesity": low muscle + high fat — both harmful

**Other considerations:**
- Slower GI transit at baseline → may have more pronounced GI AEs
- Polypharmacy → drug interactions
- Cognitive decline → may affect adherence
- Falls risk → muscle loss can increase fall risk

### Chunk 3 — Lean mass preservation strategies (critical)
**Protein:**
- Higher requirements: 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day (higher than younger adults)
- Prioritize protein at every meal
- Consider protein supplementation if inadequate intake

**Exercise:**
- Resistance training 2-3x/week is ESSENTIAL
- Prevents muscle loss during weight loss
- Improves function, balance, fall prevention
- Physical therapy referral if mobility limited

**Rate of weight loss:**
- Aim for slower, steady weight loss (~0.5-1 lb/week)
- Avoid aggressive caloric restriction
- Slower titration may improve tolerability

### Chunk 4 — Adjusting goals and monitoring
**Individualized goals:**
- Focus on functional improvement > scale weight
- Mobility, ADLs, quality of life, comorbidity improvement
- May accept more modest weight loss if function improves

**Monitoring:**
- Monitor for orthostatic hypotension (especially if on BP meds)
- Watch for unintentional excessive weight loss
- Assess muscle strength and function periodically (grip strength, chair stand)
- Check for mood changes, cognitive effects

**When to avoid or proceed cautiously:**
- Frail elderly with low BMI (may not need weight loss)
- High fall risk without ability to exercise
- Advanced dementia (adherence, safety concerns)

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Geriatric modifications for GLP-1 therapy
- Checklist: Lean mass preservation strategies

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "In older adults, it's not just about losing weight — it's about losing the *right* weight"
- Resistance training is non-negotiable; without it, weight loss may be harmful
- Functional goals (walking, stairs, ADLs) often matter more than scale numbers

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** How much protein should older adults on GLP-1 therapy aim for daily?
   - **Answer:** 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day
   - **Rationale:** Higher protein needs to counteract age-related muscle loss during weight loss
   - **Source:** Geriatric nutrition guidelines

2. **Question:** What exercise modality is most important for older adults on GLP-1 RAs?
   - **Answer:** Resistance training (2-3x/week)
   - **Rationale:** Preserves muscle mass, prevents sarcopenia, improves function and falls risk
   - **Source:** Exercise guidelines for older adults

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- No dose adjustment for age, but geriatric patients have unique risks (sarcopenia, falls)
- Lean mass preservation requires higher protein intake AND resistance training
- Focus on functional goals, not just scale weight; proceed cautiously in frail patients

## Sources
- Clinical trials geriatric subgroup data.
- Geriatric obesity management guidelines.
- Sarcopenia and exercise recommendations.

# Lesson 7.5 — Reproductive Health: Contraception, Pregnancy Planning, Lactation

## Learner level
- Provider treating reproductive-age patients
- Critical safety counseling

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Counsel patients on contraception, including tirzepatide-specific oral contraceptive interaction
2. Plan pregnancy appropriately (discontinue GLP-1 RA ≥2 months before conception)
3. Discuss what's known (and not known) about lactation

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your 32-year-old patient on tirzepatide and oral contraceptives asks about family planning. What critical counseling do you need to provide?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 03: Contraindications (pregnancy)
- Lesson 2.3: Tirzepatide interactions

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Contraception during GLP-1 therapy
**All patients of childbearing potential:**
- GLP-1 RAs are contraindicated in pregnancy (Category: avoid)
- Counsel on effective contraception before starting
- Document pregnancy test negative at baseline

**Tirzepatide-specific interaction (critical!):**
- Delayed gastric emptying may reduce absorption of oral contraceptives
- **Recommendation:** Use barrier method (condoms, etc.) in addition to oral contraceptives for:
  - 4 weeks after initiation
  - 4 weeks after each dose escalation
- Alternative: Use non-oral contraception (IUD, implant, injection, patch, ring)

**Semaglutide:**
- No specific oral contraceptive interaction noted in labeling
- General delayed gastric emptying could theoretically affect any oral medication
- Non-oral contraception remains a reasonable option

### Chunk 2 — Fertility considerations ("Ozempic babies")
**Anecdotal reports:**
- Unplanned pregnancies in patients on GLP-1 RAs, often despite oral contraceptives
- Likely multifactorial:
  - Oral contraceptive absorption reduced
  - Weight loss may restore ovulatory function in PCOS
  - Improved insulin sensitivity enhances fertility

**Counseling:**
- "Weight loss can improve fertility even if you've had difficulty conceiving before"
- "If you don't want to become pregnant, use reliable contraception"
- "If you want to become pregnant, let's plan appropriately"

### Chunk 3 — Pregnancy planning
**Recommendations:**
- Discontinue GLP-1 RA at least 2 months before attempting conception
  - Semaglutide: t½ ~1 week × 5 = ~5 weeks; 2 months provides margin
  - Tirzepatide: similar reasoning
- Achieve weight loss goals before pregnancy if possible
- Switch to pregnancy-safe weight management (lifestyle only)
- Refer to OB/maternal-fetal medicine if complex

**If pregnancy occurs during therapy:**
- Stop GLP-1 RA immediately
- Limited human data; animal studies show some risk at high doses
- Reassure but recommend OB follow-up

### Chunk 4 — Lactation
**What we know:**
- No human data on excretion in breast milk
- Animal studies: semaglutide and tirzepatide present in milk

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid during breastfeeding (per FDA labeling)
- Consider risk-benefit discussion if patient insists
- If used, monitor infant for GI symptoms, growth

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Infographic: Tirzepatide and oral contraceptive timeline
- Flowchart: Pregnancy planning steps

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- **"4 weeks after each dose increase"** — the tirzepatide OC interaction rule
- Weight loss restores fertility — warn patients who think they "can't get pregnant"
- Stop GLP-1 RA ≥2 months before trying to conceive

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** For how long after a tirzepatide dose increase should patients use backup contraception?
   - **Answer:** 4 weeks
   - **Rationale:** Delayed gastric emptying may reduce oral contraceptive absorption during this period
   - **Source:** Zepbound/Mounjaro prescribing information

2. **Question:** How long before attempting pregnancy should a GLP-1 RA be discontinued?
   - **Answer:** At least 2 months
   - **Rationale:** Allows drug washout (~5 half-lives) before conception
   - **Source:** FDA labeling; clinical guidance

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Tirzepatide requires backup contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and each dose increase
- Weight loss improves fertility — counsel all reproductive-age patients on contraception
- Stop GLP-1 RA ≥2 months before attempting pregnancy; avoid during breastfeeding

## Sources
- Zepbound and Mounjaro prescribing information (oral contraceptive interaction).
- Wegovy prescribing information.
- FDA pregnancy and lactation labeling guidance.
