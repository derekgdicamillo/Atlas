# Lesson 8.1 — Informed Consent Process

## Learner level
- Provider implementing consent workflows
- Medicolegal protection focus

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + consent template review

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. List key elements of informed consent for AOM therapy
2. Implement a consent process that documents the discussion
3. Balance thoroughness with clinical efficiency

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient develops pancreatitis 3 months into therapy. They claim they were never told about the risk. How does your consent process protect you?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 05: Adverse effects
- Module 03: Contraindications

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Why formal consent matters
- GLP-1 RAs have known risks (GI effects, pancreatitis, gallbladder, MTC concern)
- Medicolegal protection: documentation that patient understood risks
- Patient engagement: informed patients make better decisions
- Shared decision-making: demonstrates patient participated in choice

### Chunk 2 — Key consent elements
**Must include:**
1. **Indication:** Why the medication is being recommended
2. **Expected benefits:** Weight loss, comorbidity improvement (realistic expectations)
3. **Common side effects:** GI symptoms, injection site reactions
4. **Serious risks:**
   - Boxed warning (MTC/MEN2)
   - Pancreatitis
   - Gallbladder disease
   - Hypoglycemia (if on insulin/SU)
5. **Alternatives:** Other AOMs, surgery, lifestyle alone
6. **Right to refuse:** Patient can decline without affecting care
7. **Questions answered:** Patient had opportunity to ask questions

### Chunk 3 — Consent process options
**Option 1: Written consent form**
- Patient signs a dedicated consent document
- Provides clearest documentation
- Can be reviewed at home before signing

**Option 2: Verbal consent with documentation**
- Provider discusses risks/benefits verbally
- Document in note: "Risks and benefits discussed, including [list key items]. Patient verbalized understanding and consents to treatment."

**Option 3: Combination**
- Provide written information sheet
- Verbal discussion
- Document discussion occurred

**Best practice:** Written form + verbal discussion + note documentation

### Chunk 4 — Practical implementation
- **Consent form:** 1-2 pages max; readable language (avoid jargon)
- **When to obtain:** At initial visit, before first prescription
- **Re-consent:** Not routinely needed, but document ongoing discussions
- **Off-label use:** More detailed consent if using Ozempic off-label for obesity

**Template elements:**
- Patient name, date
- Medication name and indication
- Bulleted risks/benefits
- Alternatives listed
- Signature lines (patient, provider, witness optional)

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Consent form template (1-page sample)
- Checklist: Consent discussion points

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Document that the discussion happened, not just that a form was signed"
- Patients don't read long forms — keep it simple, supplement with discussion
- Update consent template when new safety information emerges

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What must be documented regarding the boxed warning?
   - **Answer:** That the MTC/MEN2 risk was discussed and patient has no personal/family history
   - **Rationale:** Medicolegal requirement given the boxed warning
   - **Source:** Standard consent practice; FDA labeling

2. **Question:** Is written consent legally required for GLP-1 RA prescribing?
   - **Answer:** Not legally mandated in most jurisdictions, but strongly recommended as best practice
   - **Rationale:** Documentation protects both patient and provider; demonstrates informed decision-making
   - **Source:** Medical-legal standards

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Informed consent should cover indication, benefits, risks (including boxed warning), alternatives, and right to refuse
- Best practice: written form + verbal discussion + note documentation
- Keep forms simple and readable; supplement with conversation

## Sources
- Medical-legal standards for informed consent.

# Lesson 8.2 — Compounding Considerations (Regulations, Risks, Sourcing)

## Learner level
- Provider considering compounded options
- Regulatory and safety awareness

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State when compounding of GLP-1 agents is permitted under federal law
2. Identify risks unique to compounded products
3. Apply due diligence when selecting a compounding pharmacy

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient can't afford brand-name Wegovy and asks about 'compounded semaglutide' they found online. What do you need to know before prescribing?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Medication overview
- Lesson 4.5: Drug shortages

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — When compounding is legally permitted
**FDA rules:**
- Compounding is allowed when a drug is on the FDA Drug Shortage List
- As of [current date], semaglutide and tirzepatide have had intermittent shortage periods
- When shortage is resolved, technically compounding should stop (gray area in practice)

**503A vs 503B pharmacies:**
- **503A:** Traditional compounding pharmacies; patient-specific prescriptions
- **503B:** Outsourcing facilities; can produce larger batches; higher FDA oversight

**Note:** Compounding is NOT simply a cost-saving alternative when branded product is available

### Chunk 2 — Differences from FDA-approved products
| Factor | Brand (Wegovy, Zepbound) | Compounded |
|--------|--------------------------|------------|
| FDA-approved | Yes | No |
| Standardized manufacturing | Yes | Variable |
| Salt form | Specific (e.g., semaglutide base) | May differ (e.g., semaglutide sodium) |
| Sterility assurance | High | Depends on pharmacy |
| Potency verification | Rigorous | Variable |
| Pen device | Yes | Usually vials + syringes |

**Key issue:** Different salt forms may have different bioavailability — clinical equivalence not established

### Chunk 3 — Risks of compounded GLP-1s
1. **Sterility concerns:** Compounding errors can cause infection
2. **Potency variability:** Under- or over-dosing possible
3. **No safety/efficacy data:** Not studied in clinical trials
4. **No lot tracking:** Harder to trace if problems occur
5. **Legal/insurance issues:** May not be covered; liability concerns
6. **Patient expectations:** May expect brand-name results

**Warning signs of problematic sources:**
- No prescription required
- Shipped from overseas
- Unusually low prices
- No pharmacy license verification

### Chunk 4 — Selecting a reputable compounding pharmacy
**Due diligence:**
- Verify state pharmacy license
- For 503B: verify FDA registration
- Ask about sterility testing and potency assays
- Request Certificates of Analysis (COA)
- Check for PCAB accreditation (voluntary quality standard)
- Ask about Beyond-Use Dating (BUD) — how long is product stable?

**Documentation:**
- Prescribe specifically from a named pharmacy
- Keep pharmacy verification records
- Document patient counseling about compounded nature

### Chunk 5 — Patient counseling for compounded products
**Must discuss:**
- "This is not the FDA-approved brand-name product"
- "Quality depends on the compounding pharmacy"
- "Clinical trial data was done with brand products, not compounded"
- "We are using this because [shortage/cost/access] with appropriate precautions"

**Document the conversation**

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Brand vs compounded comparison
- Checklist: Vetting a compounding pharmacy

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Compounding is not a generic equivalent — it's a different product
- 503B pharmacies have more FDA oversight than 503A
- When brand supply normalizes, re-evaluate compounded use

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** When is compounding of semaglutide legally permitted?
   - **Answer:** When semaglutide is on the FDA Drug Shortage List
   - **Rationale:** FDA regulations allow compounding during documented shortages
   - **Source:** FDA compounding regulations

2. **Question:** What is the key difference between 503A and 503B compounding pharmacies?
   - **Answer:** 503B facilities (outsourcing facilities) have greater FDA oversight and can produce larger batches
   - **Rationale:** 503B provides more quality assurance for sterile injectables
   - **Source:** FDA Drug Quality and Security Act

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Compounded GLP-1s are legal during shortages but are NOT equivalent to FDA-approved products
- Vet compounding pharmacies carefully (license, accreditation, sterility testing, COAs)
- Counsel patients that compounded products differ from brand and lack clinical trial data

## Sources
- FDA guidance on compounding and drug shortages.
- [[Compounded GLP-1s - Regulatory Overview (US)]].
- PCAB accreditation standards.

# Lesson 8.3 — Insurance Navigation (Prior Auth, Appeals, Patient Assistance)

## Learner level
- Provider and staff managing coverage issues
- Practical, workflow-focused

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Understand common prior authorization criteria for obesity AOMs
2. Submit complete prior auth requests to minimize denials
3. Appeal denials with additional documentation
4. Connect uninsured/underinsured patients with assistance programs

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Prior auth denied. Now what? Knowing the appeal process can save your patient from giving up on treatment."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 6.4: Documentation

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Insurance landscape for obesity AOMs
**Coverage reality:**
- Many commercial plans exclude obesity medications
- Medicare Part D explicitly excludes weight loss drugs (as of 2026 — pending legislative change)
- Medicaid: varies by state
- Some employer plans cover with prior auth

**Product-specific:**
- Wegovy/Zepbound: require obesity diagnosis + criteria
- Ozempic/Mounjaro: covered under diabetes benefit (if T2DM diagnosis)

**Strategy:** Always verify benefits before prescribing; use correct diagnosis codes

### Chunk 2 — Prior authorization requirements (typical)
**Common criteria:**
- BMI ≥30, OR BMI ≥27 with comorbidity
- Documentation of lifestyle intervention attempts (e.g., 3-6 months diet/exercise)
- No contraindications
- Prescriber attestation of medical necessity

**Required documentation:**
- Recent BMI with date
- List of comorbidities (with ICD-10 codes)
- Description of prior weight loss attempts
- Statement of medical necessity

**Tips:**
- Use the payer's PA form (not generic)
- Include all supporting documentation upfront
- Anticipate what they'll ask for

### Chunk 3 — Appealing denials
**Common denial reasons:**
- "Not medically necessary" (documentation issue)
- "Step therapy required" (must try cheaper options first)
- "Exclusion" (plan doesn't cover weight loss drugs at all)

**Appeal process:**
1. **Review denial letter:** Understand the specific reason
2. **Gather additional documentation:**
   - Letter of medical necessity (detailed)
   - Clinical notes supporting failed lifestyle attempts
   - Evidence of comorbidity severity
3. **Peer-to-peer review:** Request to speak with payer's medical director
4. **Formal appeal:** Submit within required timeframe (usually 30-60 days)
5. **External review:** If internal appeal denied, request independent review

**Letter of medical necessity template:**
- Patient identifier
- Diagnosis (obesity + comorbidities)
- Failed prior interventions
- Why this specific medication is needed
- Expected benefits
- Citation of clinical guidelines

### Chunk 4 — Patient assistance programs
**Manufacturer programs:**
- **Novo Nordisk (Wegovy):** NovoCare savings program
- **Eli Lilly (Zepbound):** Lilly Cares foundation, Zepbound Savings Card

**Eligibility:**
- Usually for commercially insured patients (not Medicare/Medicaid)
- Income-based criteria for uninsured
- May cover copay or provide free medication

**Copay cards:**
- Reduce out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured
- May have monthly/annual caps
- Don't apply to government insurance

**Other resources:**
- RxAssist, NeedyMeds (databases of assistance programs)
- Specialty pharmacies may help navigate options

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Prior auth and appeal process
- Table: Manufacturer assistance programs with eligibility

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Documentation is the key to PA success" — be thorough upfront
- Peer-to-peer review often overturns denials — request it
- Always check for savings cards — can reduce copay to $0-25/month for eligible patients

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What's the most important step to prevent prior auth denial?
   - **Answer:** Submit complete documentation upfront (BMI, comorbidities, prior interventions, medical necessity statement)
   - **Rationale:** Most denials result from incomplete documentation
   - **Source:** Insurance PA process best practices

2. **Question:** Does Medicare Part D cover weight loss medications?
   - **Answer:** No — as of 2026, Medicare Part D explicitly excludes weight loss drugs (pending legislative change)
   - **Rationale:** This is a statutory exclusion; patients must pay out of pocket or use assistance programs
   - **Source:** Medicare coverage rules

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Prior auth success depends on thorough upfront documentation (BMI, comorbidities, lifestyle attempts)
- Appeal denials with additional documentation and request peer-to-peer review
- Manufacturer savings programs and copay cards can make treatment affordable for many patients

## Sources
- Insurance industry PA standards.
- Manufacturer patient assistance program information.
- Medicare Part D coverage rules.
