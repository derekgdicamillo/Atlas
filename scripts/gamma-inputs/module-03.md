# Lesson 3.1 — Who Qualifies: BMI & Comorbidity Criteria

## Learner level
- Provider learning prescribing criteria
- Focus on regulatory compliance

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Recite FDA-approved BMI thresholds for AOM prescribing
2. List ≥5 weight-related comorbidities that qualify patients at lower BMI
3. Discuss limitations of BMI and alternative assessment approaches

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "A patient with BMI 28 and hypertension asks about Wegovy. Do they qualify? Understanding the criteria helps you prescribe confidently."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 01: Obesity as a chronic disease
- Module 02: Available medications

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — FDA-approved indications
**Wegovy & Zepbound approved for:**
- BMI ≥30 kg/m² (obesity), OR
- BMI ≥27 kg/m² (overweight) with ≥1 weight-related comorbidity

**Qualifying comorbidities:**
- Type 2 diabetes
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- Obstructive sleep apnea
- Cardiovascular disease
- NAFLD/NASH
- Osteoarthritis

### Chunk 2 — BMI limitations
- Doesn't account for muscle mass (athletes may have high BMI, low fat)
- Ethnic variations: Asian populations may have higher metabolic risk at lower BMI
  - Some guidelines suggest lower thresholds (≥25 = obesity for Asians)
- Waist circumference adds cardiometabolic risk information
- Edmonton Obesity Staging System: assesses functional impact

### Chunk 3 — Practical application
- Document BMI + comorbidity for insurance/prior auth
- If borderline (BMI 27-29.9), ensure comorbidity is clearly documented
- Consider serial weights (pattern) rather than single measurement
- Shared decision-making: even if "qualified," discuss goals and alternatives

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: BMI thresholds + qualifying comorbidities
- Checklist: Documentation requirements for prior auth

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "BMI is a starting point, not the whole picture"
- Most insurance requires documented comorbidity at BMI 27-29.9
- Asian patients may warrant treatment at lower BMI (AACE guidance)

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** At what minimum BMI can GLP-1 AOMs be prescribed with a weight-related comorbidity?
   - **Answer:** 27 kg/m²
   - **Rationale:** FDA labeling allows treatment at BMI ≥27 if comorbidity present
   - **Source:** Wegovy and Zepbound prescribing information

2. **Question:** Name three weight-related comorbidities that qualify a patient at BMI 27-29.9.
   - **Answer:** (Any 3 of) T2DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, OSA, CVD, NAFLD, osteoarthritis
   - **Rationale:** These conditions improve with weight loss and establish medical necessity
   - **Source:** FDA labeling; obesity treatment guidelines

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- FDA-approved criteria: BMI ≥30, or BMI ≥27 with weight-related comorbidity
- BMI has limitations; consider waist circumference and ethnic-specific thresholds
- Document thoroughly — clear indication + comorbidity improves coverage success

## Sources
- Wegovy and Zepbound prescribing information (FDA labels).

# Lesson 3.2 — Absolute Contraindications (Boxed Warning & Beyond)

## Learner level
- Provider learning safety criteria
- Critical for safe prescribing

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State the boxed warning for semaglutide and tirzepatide
2. List all absolute contraindications
3. Explain how to screen for MEN2/MTC family history

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "A patient mentions their mother had 'thyroid cancer.' Can you prescribe Wegovy? Knowing which thyroid cancers matter is critical."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Medication overview

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — The boxed warning (both agents)
**BLACK BOX WARNING:**
> "In rodents, semaglutide/tirzepatide causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). It is unknown whether this occurs in humans. Contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of MTC or MEN2."

**Key points:**
- Based on rodent studies (2-year carcinogenicity)
- Human relevance uncertain but precautionary
- No signal in human trials to date (but follow-up limited)

### Chunk 2 — Absolute contraindications
| Contraindication | Rationale |
|------------------|-----------|
| Personal history of MTC | Boxed warning; theoretical tumor promotion |
| Family history of MTC | Genetic predisposition (MEN2 syndrome) |
| MEN2 syndrome | Includes MTC risk |
| Known hypersensitivity | Prior allergic reaction to drug/excipients |
| Pregnancy | Fetal risk; discontinue ≥2 months before conception |

**NOT absolute contraindications:**
- Papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (different cell type — C-cell concern only)
- Family history of common thyroid cancers (unless MTC specifically)

### Chunk 3 — Screening for MTC/MEN2
**Ask:**
- "Has anyone in your family had medullary thyroid cancer?"
- "Do you have a personal or family history of MEN2 syndrome?"
- "Have you had thyroid cancer? What type?"

**If uncertain:**
- Papillary/follicular = most common (90%+); GLP-1 OK
- Medullary = rare (~4% of thyroid cancers); GLP-1 contraindicated
- If family history unclear, consider calcitonin level or referral

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Thyroid cancer history screening
- Table: Contraindications summary

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Thyroid cancer" ≠ automatic contraindication — type matters
- MEN2 is autosomal dominant; multiple family members may be affected
- Document the screening question in your note

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What thyroid cancer type is specifically mentioned in the boxed warning?
   - **Answer:** Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
   - **Rationale:** MTC arises from C-cells; rodent studies showed C-cell tumors
   - **Source:** FDA labels (all GLP-1 RAs)

2. **Question:** Is a history of papillary thyroid cancer a contraindication to semaglutide?
   - **Answer:** No — papillary cancer is not a C-cell tumor
   - **Rationale:** The boxed warning pertains to MTC and MEN2 only
   - **Source:** FDA label; clinical consensus

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Boxed warning: risk of MTC in rodents; contraindicated in MTC/MEN2
- Always ask about medullary thyroid cancer specifically (not just "thyroid cancer")
- Other absolute contraindications: hypersensitivity, pregnancy

# Lesson 3.3 — Precautions & Risk-Benefit Assessment

## Learner level
- Provider managing complex patients
- Nuanced clinical decision-making

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + case discussions

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. List ≥6 precautions for GLP-1 RA therapy
2. Describe risk mitigation strategies for each precaution
3. Engage patients in shared decision-making for borderline cases

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has a history of pancreatitis 5 years ago. Is this an absolute contraindication, or can you consider treatment?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 3.2: Absolute contraindications

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Precautions (not absolute contraindications)
| Precaution | Concern | Management |
|------------|---------|------------|
| History of pancreatitis | Increased risk (rare) | Counsel, monitor symptoms, avoid if recurrent/severe |
| Gallbladder disease | Increased cholelithiasis risk | Counsel, monitor RUQ symptoms |
| Gastroparesis | Delayed emptying → GI intolerance | Avoid or start very low/slow titration |
| Diabetic retinopathy | Rapid glycemic improvement may worsen | Ophthalmology evaluation if severe/proliferative |
| Renal impairment (severe) | Dehydration risk from GI AEs | Hydration counseling, slower titration, monitor |
| Hepatic impairment | Limited data | Use caution; start low |
| History of suicidal ideation | Theoretical CNS effect | Screen, monitor mood |

### Chunk 2 — Deep dive: Pancreatitis
- Post-marketing cases reported (rare)
- Incidence: ~0.2-0.3% in trials (similar to comparators)
- **Approach:**
  - Remote, single episode (>3-5 years): may consider with counseling
  - Recurrent or idiopathic: generally avoid
  - Active pancreatitis: absolute avoidance until resolved
- Counsel: report severe abdominal pain immediately

### Chunk 3 — Deep dive: Gallbladder
- Rapid weight loss increases cholelithiasis risk (any modality)
- GLP-1 RAs: ~2-3x increased gallbladder-related events in trials
- **Approach:**
  - Prior cholecystectomy: no concern (no gallbladder)
  - Symptomatic gallstones: treat before initiating AOM
  - Counsel: RUQ pain, especially postprandial, warrants evaluation

### Chunk 4 — Shared decision-making framework
1. Explain the precaution and potential risk
2. Discuss expected benefits (weight loss %, comorbidity improvement)
3. Present alternatives (other AOMs, bariatric surgery, lifestyle intensification)
4. Document the discussion
5. Agree on monitoring plan

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Precautions with risk level and management
- Flowchart: Pancreatitis history decision tree

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Precaution ≠ prohibition" — most can be managed with appropriate counseling
- Gallbladder events: often asymptomatic; monitor for symptoms
- Document the risk-benefit discussion in your note

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** A patient had a single episode of gallstone pancreatitis 8 years ago and has since had cholecystectomy. Is GLP-1 therapy appropriate?
   - **Answer:** Yes — with cholecystectomy, gallbladder risk is eliminated; remote pancreatitis with known cause is low risk
   - **Rationale:** Precaution applies primarily to idiopathic or recurrent pancreatitis
   - **Source:** Clinical consensus; FDA label review

2. **Question:** Why might rapid glycemic improvement worsen diabetic retinopathy?
   - **Answer:** "Early worsening" phenomenon — rapid BG changes can transiently worsen retinopathy
   - **Rationale:** Occurs with any rapid glycemic control (including insulin); monitor closely
   - **Source:** SUSTAIN 6 data; established diabetes complication knowledge

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Precautions require individualized risk-benefit assessment, not automatic avoidance
- Pancreatitis and gallbladder concerns are manageable with counseling and monitoring
- Shared decision-making and documentation protect both patient and provider

# Lesson 3.4 — Pre-Treatment Evaluation Checklist

## Learner level
- Provider ready to initiate therapy
- Practical, protocol-focused

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + checklist

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Conduct a focused history for GLP-1 RA candidacy
2. Order appropriate baseline labs
3. Document findings systematically for medical record and prior auth

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "You're ready to start a patient on Zepbound. What should you check and document before that first injection?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 3.1-3.3: Eligibility, contraindications, precautions

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — History checklist
**Must ask:**
- [ ] Current weight, height, BMI
- [ ] Weight history (max weight, prior attempts, trajectory)
- [ ] Weight-related comorbidities (T2DM, HTN, OSA, NAFLD, etc.)
- [ ] Prior AOM use and response
- [ ] Bariatric surgery history
- [ ] Thyroid history (specifically MTC/MEN2)
- [ ] Pancreatitis history
- [ ] Gallbladder history
- [ ] Renal disease
- [ ] Diabetic retinopathy status (if diabetic)
- [ ] Pregnancy status / reproductive plans
- [ ] Mental health history (depression, suicidal ideation)
- [ ] Current medications (especially insulin, sulfonylureas)

### Chunk 2 — Physical exam elements
- Weight, height, BMI calculation
- Waist circumference (optional but useful)
- Blood pressure (document HTN if present)
- Signs of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans)
- Thyroid exam (masses, nodules)
- Abdominal exam (if gallbladder concern)

### Chunk 3 — Baseline labs
**Recommended:**
| Lab | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|
| HbA1c / fasting glucose | Baseline glycemic status; screen for T2DM |
| Lipid panel | Baseline cardiometabolic risk |
| CMP (BUN/Cr, LFTs) | Renal/hepatic function |
| TSH | Baseline thyroid function |

**Consider (if indicated):**
- Calcitonin (if MTC concern)
- ALT/AST if NAFLD suspected
- Pregnancy test (reproductive age)

### Chunk 4 — Documentation for prior auth
- BMI + qualifying comorbidity (if BMI <30)
- Statement: "Patient meets FDA-approved criteria for [medication]"
- Prior weight loss attempts documented
- Contraindications reviewed and none present
- Risks/benefits discussed; patient consents to treatment

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Checklist: Pre-treatment evaluation (printable)
- Sample documentation template

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Check the box" mentality helps ensure nothing is missed
- Prior auth often requires documented failed lifestyle attempts
- TSH is baseline — not to screen for MTC (calcitonin would be if needed)

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What lab would you order if concerned about MTC risk due to family history?
   - **Answer:** Calcitonin
   - **Rationale:** Elevated calcitonin may indicate MTC; TSH does not assess C-cells
   - **Source:** ATA guidelines on thyroid nodules

2. **Question:** Why document prior weight loss attempts?
   - **Answer:** Insurance prior authorization often requires evidence of lifestyle intervention failure
   - **Rationale:** Demonstrates medical necessity for pharmacotherapy
   - **Source:** Common payer requirements

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Systematic history covers eligibility, contraindications, precautions, and prior attempts
- Baseline labs: A1c, lipids, CMP, TSH — document results
- Thorough documentation supports clinical care and insurance approval

## Sources
- AACE/ACE Obesity Clinical Practice Guidelines.
- Wegovy and Zepbound prescribing information.
- Common insurance prior authorization criteria review.

# Lesson 3.5 — Setting Expectations & Shared Decision-Making

## Learner level
- Provider preparing for treatment initiation conversation
- Patient communication focus

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + conversation scripts

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Communicate realistic weight loss expectations based on trial data
2. Prepare patients for the timeline and side effect profile
3. Explain the chronic disease treatment model and need for ongoing therapy
4. Align treatment plan with patient's personal goals

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient expects to lose 50 lbs in 3 months. How do you set realistic expectations without discouraging them?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Efficacy data (STEP, SURMOUNT)
- Lessons 3.1-3.4: Evaluation complete

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — What to expect: efficacy
**Frame the data:**
- "On average, patients lose 15-20% of their body weight"
- "For a 250 lb person, that's 35-50 lbs"
- "About 1 in 3 patients on tirzepatide lose ≥25%"
- "Results vary — some lose more, some less"

**Timeline:**
- Weight loss begins within weeks
- Most loss occurs in first 6-9 months
- Plateau is normal — maintenance is the goal

### Chunk 2 — What to expect: side effects
**GI symptoms (common, usually transient):**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
- Worst during dose escalation
- Often improve at maintenance dose
- "Let me know if severe — we can slow the titration"

**Less common concerns:**
- Gallbladder symptoms (RUQ pain)
- Injection site reactions

### Chunk 3 — Chronic disease model
**Key message:**
- "Obesity is a chronic disease — like diabetes or high blood pressure"
- "This medication treats the biological drivers, not just the symptoms"
- "If you stop the medication, weight typically returns (STEP 4 showed 2/3 regain)"
- "The goal is long-term management, not a short-term fix"

**Address the "crutch" concern:**
- "It's not a crutch — it's a treatment for a medical condition"
- "You wouldn't stop blood pressure medication once BP normalizes"

### Chunk 4 — Shared decision-making
1. **Elicit goals:** "What's most important to you about losing weight?"
2. **Discuss options:** medications, surgery, intensive lifestyle, combinations
3. **Align expectations:** "Given your goal of [X], here's what we can realistically achieve"
4. **Agree on plan:** medication choice, follow-up schedule, monitoring
5. **Revisit periodically:** adjust goals as patient progresses

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Infographic: Weight loss timeline expectations
- Conversation guide: Setting expectations

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Underpromise, overdeliver" — conservative estimates build trust
- Patients who understand the chronic model have better long-term adherence
- Non-scale victories matter: improved mobility, fewer meds, better sleep

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** How should you respond when a patient asks if they can stop the medication after reaching goal weight?
   - **Answer:** Explain that obesity is a chronic disease requiring ongoing treatment; stopping typically leads to regain (STEP 4 data)
   - **Rationale:** Prepares patient for long-term commitment
   - **Source:** Rubino D et al. JAMA 2021 (STEP 4)

2. **Question:** When are GI side effects typically worst?
   - **Answer:** During dose escalation
   - **Rationale:** Most patients have improved tolerance at maintenance dose
   - **Source:** STEP and SURMOUNT trial safety data

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Set realistic expectations: 15-20% weight loss over 6-9 months; results vary
- Prepare patients for transient GI symptoms and the need for chronic therapy
- Shared decision-making improves adherence and satisfaction
