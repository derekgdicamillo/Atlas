# Lesson 6.1 — Follow-Up Schedule (Titration vs Maintenance)

## Learner level
- Provider establishing practice workflows
- Practical scheduling focus

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State recommended follow-up intervals during dose escalation
2. Define maintenance phase follow-up schedule
3. Recognize situations requiring more frequent monitoring

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient just started Wegovy. When should you see them next? Too soon wastes visits; too long risks problems."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 04: Titration protocols

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Titration phase follow-up (weeks 1-20)
**Recommended schedule:**
- **Week 4:** First follow-up (after 0.25 mg phase)
  - Assess tolerability, answer questions, review technique
  - If tolerating, continue escalation per protocol
- **Week 8-12:** Check-in (phone or visit)
  - Tolerability check, weight trend
  - Address any issues before reaching higher doses
- **Week 16-20:** Visit at or near maintenance dose
  - Comprehensive assessment, labs, document response

**Flexibility:**
- More frequent if tolerability issues (every 2 weeks)
- Virtual/phone check-ins can supplement in-person visits

### Chunk 2 — Maintenance phase follow-up
**Once at stable maintenance dose:**
- **Month 3:** First maintenance visit
- **Then every 3 months** for the first year
- **After year 1:** Can extend to every 6 months if stable

**Each maintenance visit:**
- Weight, vital signs
- Review dietary adherence, physical activity
- Assess for adverse effects
- Reinforce lifestyle optimization
- Refill prescriptions

### Chunk 3 — Situations requiring more frequent visits
- **GI intolerance:** Every 2 weeks during dose adjustment
- **Weight loss plateau:** Evaluate every 4 weeks to assess and adjust
- **Comorbidity management:** May need coordination (e.g., diabetes med adjustments)
- **Psychological concerns:** Closer monitoring if mood changes noted
- **Post-interruption restart:** Follow titration schedule visits again

### Chunk 4 — Visit types and billing considerations
- **In-person visits:** Preferred for initial, comprehensive, and annual assessments
- **Telehealth:** Appropriate for interim check-ins, stable patients
- **Phone/portal messages:** Can handle simple questions, refill requests
- **Bill appropriately:** E/M codes based on complexity; document to support level

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Timeline: Follow-up schedule from initiation through year 1
- Table: Visit types and when to use each

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "The first 16 weeks need the most touchpoints"
- Phone check-ins prevent small issues from becoming big ones
- Stable patients need less frequent visits — don't over-schedule

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** How often should patients be seen during the first 16 weeks of GLP-1 therapy?
   - **Answer:** At least at weeks 4, 8-12, and 16-20 (approximately monthly)
   - **Rationale:** Titration phase has highest risk of tolerability issues
   - **Source:** Clinical practice recommendations

2. **Question:** After the first year on stable maintenance, how often can visits be spaced?
   - **Answer:** Every 6 months (if stable and no concerns)
   - **Rationale:** Less frequent visits appropriate for stable chronic management
   - **Source:** Obesity medicine practice guidelines

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Titration phase: visits at weeks 4, 8-12, and 16-20 minimum
- Maintenance phase: every 3 months year 1, then every 6 months if stable
- Adjust frequency based on individual needs (tolerability, response, comorbidities)

# Lesson 6.2 — Laboratory Monitoring Protocol

## Learner level
- Provider establishing monitoring protocols
- Evidence-based lab ordering

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + lab panel table

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. List baseline labs before initiating GLP-1 RA therapy
2. State follow-up lab schedule and intervals
3. Interpret expected lab changes and identify concerning findings

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient's A1c dropped from 7.2% to 5.8% after 6 months on tirzepatide. Great news — but what do you need to check, and what might you adjust?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 3.4: Pre-treatment evaluation
- Module 05: Adverse effects (hypoglycemia risk)

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Baseline labs (before initiation)
| Lab | Rationale |
|-----|-----------|
| HbA1c or fasting glucose | Baseline glycemic status; diagnose/stage diabetes |
| Lipid panel | Baseline cardiovascular risk; expected to improve |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel | Renal function (Cr/BUN), liver enzymes, electrolytes |
| TSH | Baseline thyroid function |
| Pregnancy test (if applicable) | Contraindicated in pregnancy |

**Optional/as indicated:**
- Vitamin B12 (if on metformin)
- ALT/AST if NAFLD suspected
- Calcitonin (if MTC family history concern)

### Chunk 2 — Follow-up lab schedule
| Timepoint | Labs |
|-----------|------|
| 3 months | Consider A1c if diabetic; assess tolerability clinically |
| 6 months | A1c, lipid panel, CMP (especially if weight loss >10%) |
| 12 months | Full panel: A1c, lipids, CMP, TSH |
| Annually thereafter | A1c (if diabetic), lipid panel, CMP, TSH |

**Adjust frequency based on:**
- Diabetes status and control
- Baseline abnormalities
- Symptoms suggesting issues

### Chunk 3 — Expected lab improvements
- **A1c:** Decrease 0.5-1.5% (or more with tirzepatide)
- **Fasting glucose:** Decrease
- **Triglycerides:** Often decrease significantly
- **LDL:** Modest decrease (variable)
- **HDL:** May increase modestly
- **ALT:** Often improves if elevated at baseline (NAFLD improvement)
- **Blood pressure:** Not a lab but typically improves

### Chunk 4 — Concerning findings and actions
| Finding | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| A1c drops rapidly + on insulin/SU | Hypoglycemia risk | Reduce/stop insulin or SU |
| Rising creatinine | Dehydration from GI AEs | Ensure hydration; hold if significant AKI |
| Elevated lipase (asymptomatic) | Nonspecific | Repeat; evaluate if >3x ULN or symptomatic |
| Elevated lipase + abdominal pain | Acute pancreatitis | Stop GLP-1; workup and treat |
| New thyroid nodule | Incidental or concern | Ultrasound; evaluate per guidelines |

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Lab monitoring schedule
- Flowchart: Abnormal lab response algorithm

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Expect A1c and lipid improvements — celebrate these wins with patients
- Rapid A1c drop in diabetics = reduce other glucose-lowering meds proactively
- Mild lipase elevation without symptoms is common and usually benign

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** When should you repeat a full metabolic panel during GLP-1 therapy?
   - **Answer:** At 6 months and 12 months (then annually)
   - **Rationale:** Monitors renal/hepatic function during weight loss phase
   - **Source:** Clinical practice protocols

2. **Question:** A diabetic patient's A1c drops from 8.0% to 6.2% after 4 months on semaglutide. What medication adjustment is indicated?
   - **Answer:** Reduce or discontinue insulin and/or sulfonylurea to prevent hypoglycemia
   - **Rationale:** Rapid glycemic improvement increases hypoglycemia risk with these agents
   - **Source:** ADA guidelines; clinical judgment

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Baseline labs: A1c, lipids, CMP, TSH (+ pregnancy test if applicable)
- Follow-up: 6-month and 12-month panels; annually thereafter
- Expect improvements in glycemic and metabolic markers; adjust concurrent meds accordingly

# Lesson 6.3 — Tracking Progress (Weight, Body Composition, Non-Scale Victories)

## Learner level
- Provider monitoring treatment outcomes
- Patient motivation focus

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Calculate and interpret percent weight loss
2. Discuss methods for tracking body composition
3. Identify and document non-scale victories to motivate patients

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient is frustrated — the scale hasn't moved in 3 weeks. But their pants fit better and their A1c dropped. How do you reframe success?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Efficacy expectations

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Weight tracking
**Percent weight loss calculation:**
- Formula: ((Starting weight - Current weight) / Starting weight) × 100
- Example: 250 lbs → 215 lbs = (35/250) × 100 = 14% weight loss

**Benchmarks:**
- ≥5% = clinically meaningful (comorbidity improvement begins)
- ≥10% = significant metabolic benefits
- ≥15% = approaches surgical outcomes

**Tracking tips:**
- Same scale, same time of day (morning, post-void)
- Weekly weigh-ins (daily can cause anxiety; monthly misses trends)
- Graph the trend, not individual data points

### Chunk 2 — Body composition considerations
**Why it matters:**
- Weight loss = fat mass + lean mass
- Goal: maximize fat loss, minimize muscle loss
- Rapid weight loss → higher muscle loss (bad for metabolism)

**Assessment methods:**
- **Waist circumference:** Simple, correlates with visceral fat
- **Bioelectrical impedance (BIA):** Office scales with body composition (variable accuracy)
- **DEXA scan:** Gold standard but costly; consider for research or select patients

**Preserving lean mass:**
- Adequate protein (1.0-1.2 g/kg ideal body weight/day minimum; some recommend higher)
- Resistance training (2-3x/week)
- Avoid crash dieting; steady weight loss (~1-2 lbs/week)

### Chunk 3 — Non-scale victories (NSVs)
**Document and celebrate:**
- Improved mobility (walking farther, climbing stairs)
- Reduced joint pain
- Better sleep, less snoring, improved OSA
- Reduced or discontinued medications (BP meds, diabetes meds)
- Improved energy and mood
- Clothing fitting better / sizes down
- Better lab values (A1c, lipids, liver enzymes)
- Improved self-confidence

**Why NSVs matter:**
- Scale plateaus are frustrating; NSVs maintain motivation
- Health improvements often precede major scale changes
- Patient-centered care = valuing what matters to the patient

### Chunk 4 — SMART goal setting
- **Specific:** "Lose 15 lbs" vs "lose weight"
- **Measurable:** Track with weekly weigh-ins
- **Achievable:** Based on medication efficacy data (~10-20%)
- **Relevant:** Tied to patient's priorities (e.g., "fit into clothes for daughter's wedding")
- **Time-bound:** "In the next 6 months"

**Reassess goals at each visit; adjust as needed**

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Graph: Sample weight loss trajectory with plateau annotation
- Checklist: Non-scale victories to assess at each visit

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Percent weight loss matters more than absolute pounds"
- Protein and resistance training are non-negotiable for muscle preservation
- Always ask about NSVs — they're often what the patient values most

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What minimum percent weight loss is considered clinically meaningful?
   - **Answer:** 5%
   - **Rationale:** Comorbidity improvements (glycemia, BP, lipids) begin at this threshold
   - **Source:** Obesity treatment guidelines

2. **Question:** How can patients preserve lean mass during GLP-1 therapy?
   - **Answer:** Adequate protein intake (≥1.0 g/kg) and resistance training 2-3x/week
   - **Rationale:** Counteracts muscle loss that occurs with caloric deficit
   - **Source:** Nutrition and exercise guidelines

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Track percent weight loss and trend over time, not daily fluctuations
- Body composition matters: prioritize protein and resistance training to preserve muscle
- Non-scale victories (mobility, energy, medications reduced) sustain motivation through plateaus

## Sources
- Obesity treatment outcome guidelines.
- Dietary protein and exercise recommendations.
- Patient-centered care principles.

- Compliance and quality focus

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + templates

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Identify required elements for AOM visit documentation
2. Use templates for baseline, titration, and maintenance visits
3. Document to support insurance prior authorization

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient's prior auth was denied because documentation didn't support medical necessity. What should you have included?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 3.4: Pre-treatment evaluation

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Essential documentation elements

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "If it's not documented, it didn't happen"
- Templates ensure consistency and prevent omissions
- Prior auth success depends on documentation quality — invest time upfront

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What must be documented to support prior auth for a patient with BMI 28?
   - **Answer:** BMI, qualifying comorbidity (with diagnosis code), and statement of medical necessity
   - **Rationale:** BMI <30 requires documented comorbidity per FDA labeling and payer requirements
   - **Source:** Insurance prior auth criteria

2. **Question:** What screening questions must be documented at baseline?
   - **Answer:** MTC/MEN2 family history, pancreatitis history, pregnancy status, contraindication review
   - **Rationale:** Required safety screening per FDA labeling

# Lesson 6.5 — Assessing Response & When to Adjust Therapy

## Learner level
- Provider making treatment decisions
- Clinical judgment focus

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture + decision tree

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Define response thresholds (5% at 12-16 weeks)
2. Decide when to continue, intensify, or change therapy
3. Discuss options for patients who don't respond to first-line AOM

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has been on Wegovy 2.4 mg for 4 months and lost only 3%. Is this a failure? What's next?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 6.3: Progress tracking
- Module 02: Efficacy expectations

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Defining response
**Adequate response:**
- ≥5% weight loss by 12-16 weeks at maintenance dose
- OR significant improvement in weight-related comorbidities
- OR meaningful non-scale victories (mobility, function, quality of life)

**Inadequate response:**
- <5% weight loss after 12-16 weeks at max tolerated dose
- No meaningful comorbidity improvement
- Patient dissatisfaction with progress

**Note:** Some guidelines use "4% at 16 weeks" as threshold — 5% is commonly used clinically

### Chunk 2 — When to continue current therapy
- Meeting ≥5% weight loss target
- Still in escalation phase (give time to reach maintenance dose)
- Patient satisfied with progress
- Comorbidities improving even if weight loss modest
- Weight plateau after significant initial loss (normal; doesn't mean failure)

### Chunk 3 — When to intensify or adjust
**Intensify if:**
- Response present but suboptimal (<10%) and tolerating medication
- Not yet at max dose
- Room to add lifestyle intensification

**Options to intensify:**
- Increase dose if not at maximum
- Add structured lifestyle program (behavioral support, dietitian)
- Add physical activity prescription
- Consider switching to tirzepatide if on semaglutide (potentially greater efficacy)
- In future: combination therapy (experimental)

### Chunk 4 — When to discontinue or change
**Discontinue current therapy if:**
- <5% weight loss after ≥16 weeks at max tolerated dose
- Intolerable adverse effects despite dose adjustment
- Patient preference to stop

**Options after inadequate response:**
1. **Switch agents:** Semaglutide → tirzepatide (or vice versa)
2. **Consider other AOMs:** Phentermine combo, others
3. **Bariatric surgery referral:** If BMI criteria met and interested
4. **Lifestyle optimization:** Intensive behavioral therapy, meal replacement

**Document decision rationale**

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Response assessment decision tree
- Table: Options for inadequate responders

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "5% at 16 weeks" is the key benchmark — don't give up too early
- Plateaus are normal; distinguish plateau from true non-response
- Switching from semaglutide to tirzepatide is a valid strategy (different mechanism)

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What weight loss threshold defines adequate response at 16 weeks?
   - **Answer:** ≥5% from baseline
   - **Rationale:** This is the minimum clinically meaningful weight loss threshold
   - **Source:** Obesity treatment guidelines; FDA labeling

2. **Question:** What should you do if a patient achieves only 3% weight loss on max dose semaglutide at 16 weeks?
   - **Answer:** Consider switching to tirzepatide, adding intensive lifestyle support, or discussing other options (surgery, alternative AOM)
   - **Rationale:** <5% at max dose = inadequate response; change in approach is warranted
   - **Source:** Clinical practice guidelines

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Adequate response = ≥5% weight loss by 12-16 weeks at maintenance dose
- Inadequate responders: switch agents, intensify lifestyle, or consider surgery
- Plateaus after initial success are normal — don't confuse with true non-response

## Sources
- AACE/ACE obesity treatment guidelines.
- FDA labeling response criteria.
- Clinical practice consensus.
