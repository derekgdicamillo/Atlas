**URGENT: APPEAL OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DENIAL**

**To:** [INSURANCE COMPANY NAME] Appeals Department
**Re:** Appeal for [MEDICATION NAME] — [PATIENT NAME]
**Member ID:** [INSURANCE ID]
**DOB:** [DATE OF BIRTH]
**Denial Reference #:** [DENIAL REFERENCE NUMBER]
**Date of Denial:** [DENIAL DATE]

---

Dear Appeals Review Committee:

I am writing to formally appeal the denial of prior authorization for **[MEDICATION NAME]** for my patient, **[PATIENT NAME]**. The denial letter dated [DATE] cited the following reason(s):

> **[COPY EXACT DENIAL REASON FROM LETTER]**

I respectfully disagree with this determination and request reconsideration based on the following:

---

### Response to Denial Reason(s)

#### If denied for "Not Medically Necessary":

The requested medication IS medically necessary because:

1. **[PATIENT NAME] has documented obesity** with BMI of **[BMI] kg/m²**, meeting FDA-approved criteria for anti-obesity medication.

2. **The patient has [NUMBER] weight-related comorbidities:**
   - [List each with ICD-10 code]
   - These conditions are expected to improve significantly with weight loss

3. **Lifestyle interventions have failed:**
   - [Specific intervention 1]: [Duration] — [Outcome]
   - [Specific intervention 2]: [Duration] — [Outcome]
   - Per clinical guidelines, pharmacotherapy is indicated after lifestyle failure

4. **Clinical evidence strongly supports efficacy:**
   - [STEP/SURMOUNT trial data as appropriate]
   - FDA approved this medication specifically for this indication

---

#### If denied for "Step Therapy Required":

1. The patient **has already tried** the required step therapy medications:
   - [Medication 1]: [Duration] — [Reason for discontinuation: ineffective/intolerant/contraindicated]
   - [Medication 2]: [Duration] — [Reason for discontinuation]

2. **OR** Step therapy is inappropriate for this patient because:
   - [Medical reason why other medications are contraindicated]
   - [Documentation attached]

---

#### If denied for "Exclusion / Not Covered":

1. This medication **is FDA-approved** for the treatment of obesity, which is a recognized chronic disease.

2. Denial of treatment for obesity while covering treatment for obesity-related comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) is medically inconsistent and may result in:
   - Progression of existing comorbidities
   - Development of additional obesity-related conditions
   - Increased long-term healthcare costs

3. I request an **exception to the exclusion** based on documented medical necessity and the patient's specific clinical circumstances.

---

### Additional Documentation Enclosed

- [ ] Updated letter of medical necessity
- [ ] Recent office visit notes
- [ ] Laboratory results
- [ ] Documentation of prior treatment failures
- [ ] Relevant clinical guidelines (AACE/ACE, Endocrine Society)
- [ ] Peer-reviewed literature supporting efficacy

---

### Request for Peer-to-Peer Review

I am available for a peer-to-peer discussion with your medical director to review this case in detail. Please contact my office at **[PHONE NUMBER]** to schedule.

---

### Conclusion

Denial of **[MEDICATION NAME]** for **[PATIENT NAME]** does not reflect current clinical evidence or established treatment guidelines for obesity management. This patient has documented medical necessity, has failed prior interventions, and meets all FDA-approved criteria for this medication.

I urge you to reverse this denial and approve coverage for this medically necessary treatment.

Sincerely,

# Letter of Medical Necessity — GLP-1 Anti-Obesity Medication

## Instructions
1. Copy this template to your letterhead
2. Fill in bracketed fields with patient-specific information
3. Attach supporting documentation (labs, records of prior interventions)
4. Submit with prior authorization form

---

**Group #:** [GROUP NUMBER]

Dear Medical Director / Pharmacy Review Team:

I am writing to request prior authorization for **[MEDICATION NAME (e.g., Wegovy 2.4 mg, Zepbound)]** for my patient, **[PATIENT NAME]**, for the treatment of **obesity / chronic weight management**.

### Patient Information

**Current Metrics:**
- Height: [HEIGHT]
- Weight: [WEIGHT] lbs
- BMI: **[BMI] kg/m²** (measured [DATE])

**Diagnosis:**
- Primary: Obesity (ICD-10: E66.9) [or specify E66.01 for morbid obesity]
- Weight-related comorbidities:
  - [ ] Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (E11.9)
  - [ ] Hypertension (I10)
  - [ ] Dyslipidemia (E78.5)
  - [ ] Obstructive Sleep Apnea (G47.33)
  - [ ] NAFLD/NASH (K76.0 / K75.81)
  - [ ] Osteoarthritis (M19.90)
  - [ ] Cardiovascular Disease ([specify])
  - [ ] Other: [specify]

### FDA-Approved Indication

[PATIENT NAME] meets FDA-approved criteria for [MEDICATION NAME]:
- [X] BMI ≥30 kg/m², **OR**
- [X] BMI ≥27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity (documented above)

### Prior Weight Loss Interventions

The patient has attempted the following weight loss interventions without achieving sustained, clinically meaningful weight loss:

| Intervention | Duration | Outcome |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| [Dietary modification / calorie restriction] | [X months] | [Lost X lbs, regained] |
| [Exercise program] | [X months] | [Minimal sustained loss] |
| [Behavioral counseling] | [X months] | [Outcome] |
| [Prior AOM: specify] | [X months] | [Outcome / intolerance / contraindication] |
| [Other: specify] | [Duration] | [Outcome] |

Despite these interventions, the patient has been unable to achieve or maintain ≥5% weight loss, indicating the need for pharmacotherapy as recommended by clinical guidelines (AACE/ACE, Endocrine Society, AHA/ACC/TOS).

### Medical Necessity Statement

**[MEDICATION NAME]** is medically necessary for this patient because:

1. **Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease** requiring ongoing treatment, similar to hypertension or diabetes.

2. **Lifestyle intervention alone has proven insufficient** — the patient has documented failed attempts at sustained weight loss through diet, exercise, and behavioral modification.

3. **The patient has significant weight-related comorbidities** that are expected to improve with weight loss, including: [LIST KEY COMORBIDITIES].

4. **Clinical trial evidence supports efficacy:**
   - [For semaglutide]: STEP trials demonstrated 14.9% mean weight loss with 86% of patients achieving ≥5% loss
   - [For tirzepatide]: SURMOUNT trials demonstrated 20.9% mean weight loss with 91% of patients achieving ≥5% loss
   - [For semaglutide + CVD]: SELECT trial demonstrated 20% reduction in major cardiovascular events

5. **No contraindications exist** — the patient has been screened and has no personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 syndrome, no active pregnancy, and no hypersensitivity to the medication.

### Requested Medication

- **Medication:** [MEDICATION NAME]
- **Dose:** [Starting dose] titrated to [maintenance dose] per FDA-approved schedule
- **Quantity:** 4 pens per 28 days (4-week supply)
- **Duration:** Ongoing (chronic disease management)

### Conclusion

Based on the clinical evidence and this patient's documented medical history, **[MEDICATION NAME]** is medically necessary and appropriate for the treatment of obesity. Denial of this medication would likely result in continued weight gain, worsening of comorbid conditions, and increased long-term healthcare costs.

I am available to discuss this case further via peer-to-peer review if needed.

Thank you for your prompt consideration.

Sincerely,

**[PROVIDER NAME], [CREDENTIALS]**
