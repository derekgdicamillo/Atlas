# GLP-1 AOM Prescriber Cheat Sheet

## Patient Eligibility

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---|---|
| BMI alone | 30 or higher |
| BMI + comorbidity | 27 or higher with at least one: T2DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, OSA, CVD, NAFLD |
| Age | 12+ (semaglutide), 18+ (tirzepatide for obesity) |

## Absolute Contraindications

- Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2)
- Known hypersensitivity to semaglutide or tirzepatide
- Pregnancy (Category X equivalent: discontinue before planned conception)
- Active pancreatitis

## Relative Contraindications / Precautions

- History of pancreatitis (use with caution, monitor)
- Severe GI disease (gastroparesis, IBD with active flare)
- CKD Stage 4-5 (limited data, use cautiously)
- History of suicidal behavior or ideation (FDA monitoring recommendation)
- Diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide: risk of worsening in T2DM patients)
- Gallbladder disease history (increased cholelithiasis risk)

## Pre-Treatment Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] BMI + waist circumference
- [ ] Body composition baseline (body comp scale)
- [ ] Blood pressure
- [ ] Labs: CBC, CMP, lipid panel, A1c, TSH, fasting insulin
- [ ] Liver: ALT, AST, FIB-4 calculation
- [ ] Renal: eGFR, UACR
- [ ] Pregnancy test (reproductive-age females)
- [ ] Medication reconciliation (insulin, sulfonylureas need dose reduction)
- [ ] Thyroid exam (palpation)
- [ ] Informed consent signed
- [ ] Mental health screening (PHQ-9 or equivalent)

## Semaglutide Dosing Ladder (Wegovy)

| Week | Dose | Pen |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | 0.25 mg weekly | Yellow |
| 5-8 | 0.5 mg weekly | Blue |
| 9-12 | 1.0 mg weekly | Green |
| 13-16 | 1.7 mg weekly | Teal |
| 17+ | 2.4 mg weekly | Purple |

Titration pace: Minimum 4 weeks per step. Slower if GI intolerance. Can hold at any dose if patient tolerating well and losing weight.

## Tirzepatide Dosing Ladder (Zepbound)

| Week | Dose | Pen |
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 | 2.5 mg weekly | Gray |
| 5-8 | 5.0 mg weekly | Teal |
| 9-12 | 7.5 mg weekly | Purple |
| 13-16 | 10.0 mg weekly | Blue |
| 17-20 | 12.5 mg weekly | Orange |
| 21+ | 15.0 mg weekly | Maroon |

Titration pace: Minimum 4 weeks per step. Titrate for efficacy and tolerability.

## Missed Dose Decision Tree

**Semaglutide:**
- Missed by 5 days or less: Take immediately, resume regular schedule
- Missed by more than 5 days: Skip dose, take on next regular day
- Missed 2+ consecutive weeks: Consider restarting at current dose or one step down

**Tirzepatide:**
- Missed by 4 days or less: Take immediately, resume regular schedule
- Missed by more than 4 days: Skip dose, take on next regular day
- Missed 4+ consecutive weeks: Restart at 2.5 mg and re-titrate

## Top 5 Adverse Effects: Quick Management

### 1. Nausea (40-50% incidence)
- Eat smaller, more frequent meals
- Avoid fatty, greasy, or spicy foods
- Stay hydrated (clear fluids, electrolytes)
- Ondansetron 4-8 mg PRN if persistent
- Slow titration (extend current dose 4+ weeks)

### 2. Constipation (20-30%)
- Increase fiber gradually (25-35g/day target)
- Hydration minimum 64 oz/day
- MiraLAX (PEG 3350) 17g daily PRN
- Add magnesium citrate 200-400 mg nightly
- Increase physical activity

### 3. Diarrhea (15-25%)
- Usually transient (first 2-4 weeks of new dose)
- Dietary modification: reduce high-fat meals
- Loperamide 2 mg PRN (max 16 mg/day)
- Rule out IBD flare if patient has history
- If persistent >2 weeks: evaluate for other causes

### 4. Injection Site Reactions (5-10%)
- Rotate sites (abdomen, thigh, upper arm)
- Allow medication to reach room temperature before injection
- Ice pack before/after if persistent
- Usually resolves spontaneously

### 5. Headache (10-15%)
- Usually self-limiting (first 2-4 weeks)
- Ensure adequate hydration
- Acetaminophen or ibuprofen PRN
- If persistent: check blood pressure, assess caffeine intake

## Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

| Symptom | Concern | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Severe abdominal pain radiating to back | Pancreatitis | HOLD medication, lipase, ER referral if severe |
| RUQ pain with nausea/vomiting | Cholelithiasis/cholecystitis | HOLD medication, RUQ ultrasound, surgical consult |
| Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) | Hypersensitivity | STOP permanently, epinephrine, ER |
| Persistent severe vomiting (>48h) | Dehydration, AKI risk | HOLD medication, check BMP/creatinine, IV fluids |
| Rapid vision changes (T2DM patients) | Diabetic retinopathy worsening | Urgent ophthalmology referral |
| Suicidal ideation | Psychiatric emergency | Immediate safety assessment, psychiatric referral |
| Thyroid mass or neck swelling | Thyroid neoplasm concern | STOP medication, thyroid US, calcitonin, ENT referral |

## Follow-Up Schedule

### Titration Phase (Months 1-6)
- Visit every 4-6 weeks during dose escalation
- Labs at 3 months: CMP, lipid panel, A1c (if diabetic)
- Body composition at each visit

### Maintenance Phase (Month 6+)
- Visit every 3 months for first year
- Labs every 6 months: CMP, lipid panel, A1c, TSH annually
- Body composition at each visit
- Annual: UACR, FIB-4, vitamin D, B12 (if on metformin)

## Key Labs to Monitor

| Lab | When | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CMP (includes creatinine) | Baseline, 3mo, q6mo | Renal function, electrolytes |
| Lipid panel | Baseline, 3mo, q6mo | CV risk tracking |
| A1c | Baseline, 3mo, then q6mo | Glycemic control (all patients, not just T2DM) |
| TSH | Baseline, annually | Thyroid monitoring |
| ALT/AST | Baseline, 3mo, then q6mo | Liver health, NAFLD tracking |
| CBC | Baseline, annually | General health screen |
| Vitamin D | Baseline, annually | Common deficiency in obesity |
| UACR | Baseline, annually | Renal protection monitoring |
| FIB-4 (calculated) | Baseline, annually | Non-invasive fibrosis screening |

## Insurance / Prior Authorization Tips

- Document BMI + at least one weight-related comorbidity
- Include failed lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise attempts)
- Reference FDA-approved indication for the specific medication
- Use letter of medical necessity template (see Documentation Toolkit)
- For denials: appeal with additional clinical documentation, peer-to-peer if needed
- Patient assistance programs: Novo Nordisk (semaglutide), Eli Lilly (tirzepatide)
- Some plans require step therapy (try lower cost options first)

## Quick Drug Interaction Reminders

- **Insulin/sulfonylureas**: Reduce dose 20-50% at GLP-1 initiation (hypoglycemia risk)
- **Oral contraceptives**: No interaction with injection; some concern with oral semaglutide (delayed gastric emptying)
- **Warfarin**: Monitor INR more frequently during initiation/titration
- **Oral medications generally**: Delayed gastric emptying may affect absorption timing
- **Metformin**: Safe to combine; no dose adjustment needed
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Safe to combine; complementary mechanisms
