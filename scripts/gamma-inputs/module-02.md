# Lesson 2.1 — The AOM Landscape (Classes & Approvals)

## Learner level
- Provider entering AOM prescribing
- Foundation for medication selection

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + comparison table

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Name the 5 FDA-approved AOM classes
2. Identify which products are approved specifically for chronic weight management
3. Distinguish obesity-indication products (Wegovy, Zepbound) from diabetes products (Ozempic, Mounjaro)

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "A patient brings in a TikTok about 'Ozempic for weight loss.' Is that the same as Wegovy? Can you prescribe it? Understanding the regulatory landscape matters."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 01: Why pharmacotherapy is needed
- Basic understanding of FDA approval process

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — The AOM class overview
FDA-approved anti-obesity medications (BMI ≥30, or ≥27 with comorbidity):
1. **Sympathomimetics:** phentermine, diethylpropion (short-term)
2. **Combination:** phentermine/topiramate ER (Qsymia)
3. **Opioid/dopamine modulator:** naltrexone/bupropion ER (Contrave)
4. **Lipase inhibitor:** orlistat (Xenical, Alli)
5. **Incretin-based:** semaglutide (Wegovy), tirzepatide (Zepbound)

### Chunk 2 — Incretin products: obesity vs diabetes indications
| Drug | Brand (Obesity) | Brand (T2DM) | Indication |
|------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Semaglutide | Wegovy | Ozempic | Obesity: Wegovy; T2DM: Ozempic |
| Tirzepatide | Zepbound | Mounjaro | Obesity: Zepbound; T2DM: Mounjaro |

- Same molecule, different dose escalation and max dose
- Insurance/coverage often tied to indication-specific product
- Off-label use (Ozempic for weight loss) common but has coverage/supply implications

### Chunk 3 — Why this matters clinically
- Prescribing the wrong product → prior auth denial
- Supply issues have affected all products at various times
- Patient education: "You may see different names — they're related but not identical"

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: FDA-approved AOMs with mechanism, brand names, and approval year
- Diagram: Semaglutide/Tirzepatide brand family tree

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Wegovy max dose: 2.4 mg weekly; Ozempic max: 2 mg weekly
- Zepbound and Mounjaro have identical dose strengths (up to 15 mg weekly)
- Always verify insurance formulary — obesity vs diabetes coverage differs dramatically

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Which semaglutide product is FDA-approved specifically for chronic weight management?
   - **Answer:** Wegovy
   - **Rationale:** Ozempic is approved for T2DM; Wegovy has the obesity indication and higher max dose
   - **Source:** FDA label, Wegovy prescribing information

2. **Question:** What is the maximum weekly dose of tirzepatide for both Zepbound and Mounjaro?
   - **Answer:** 15 mg
   - **Rationale:** Unlike semaglutide products, tirzepatide has the same max dose for both indications
   - **Source:** FDA labels, Zepbound and Mounjaro prescribing information

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Five AOM classes exist; incretin-based agents show the greatest efficacy
- Same molecule can have different brand names based on indication (obesity vs diabetes)
- Knowing the regulatory landscape helps with prescribing, coverage, and patient education

# Lesson 2.2 — Semaglutide Deep Dive (Wegovy & Ozempic)

## Learner level
- Provider learning specific medication details
- Ready for prescribing-level knowledge

## Time + format
- Time: 20 min
- Format: Video lecture + efficacy graphs

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Explain how semaglutide achieves its long half-life (~1 week)
2. State mean weight loss outcomes from STEP 1 (%, kg)
3. Recite the Wegovy dose escalation schedule
4. Identify key differences between Wegovy and Ozempic

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient asks: 'How much weight can I expect to lose on Wegovy?' Let's look at what the data actually shows."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 1.3: GLP-1 physiology and the incretin effect
- Lesson 2.1: AOM landscape

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Pharmacology
- **Mechanism:** GLP-1 receptor agonist (94% homology to native GLP-1)
- **Modifications:** Albumin binding via fatty acid chain → extended half-life (~1 week)
- **Multi-organ action:** Pancreas (insulin↑, glucagon↓), stomach (delayed emptying), CNS (satiety↑)
- **Administration:** Subcutaneous injection, once weekly, any time of day

### Chunk 2 — STEP program efficacy highlights
| Trial | Population | Mean Weight Loss (%) | % Achieving ≥5% | % Achieving ≥10% |
|-------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| STEP 1 | Obesity w/o T2DM | -14.9% | 86% | 69% |
| STEP 2 | Obesity + T2DM | -9.6% | 69% | 46% |
| STEP 3 | + intensive behavioral | -16.0% | 86% | 75% |
| STEP 4 | Withdrawal study | Regained 2/3 after stopping | — | — |

- SELECT trial: 20% CV risk reduction in patients with obesity and established CVD

### Chunk 3 — Dose escalation (Wegovy)
| Weeks | Dose |
|-------|------|
| 1-4 | 0.25 mg |
| 5-8 | 0.5 mg |
| 9-12 | 1.0 mg |
| 13-16 | 1.7 mg |
| 17+ | 2.4 mg (maintenance) |

- Escalation minimizes GI side effects
- Can slow escalation if tolerability issues arise
- Pen strengths: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.7, 2.4 mg

### Chunk 4 — Wegovy vs Ozempic
| Feature | Wegovy | Ozempic |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Indication | Chronic weight management | T2DM |
| Max dose | 2.4 mg/week | 2.0 mg/week |
| Dose escalation | 5 steps | 3-4 steps |
| Insurance | Obesity benefit (often excluded) | Diabetes benefit |

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Graph: STEP 1 weight loss trajectory over 68 weeks
- Table: Dose escalation schedule with pen colors

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "14.9% weight loss" = ~35 lbs for a 230 lb patient
- CV benefit (SELECT) may drive insurance coverage expansion
- Most weight loss occurs in first 6 months; maintenance continues efficacy

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What was the mean percent weight loss in STEP 1 at 68 weeks?
   - **Answer:** -14.9%
   - **Rationale:** This established semaglutide 2.4 mg as the most effective approved AOM at the time
   - **Source:** Wilding JPH et al. NEJM 2021

2. **Question:** What is the maintenance dose of Wegovy?
   - **Answer:** 2.4 mg weekly
   - **Rationale:** Escalation over 16 weeks minimizes GI adverse effects before reaching maintenance
   - **Source:** Wegovy prescribing information

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Semaglutide 2.4 mg (Wegovy) achieves ~15% weight loss with 86% of patients losing ≥5%
- 5-step dose escalation over 16 weeks improves tolerability
- SELECT trial showed 20% CV risk reduction — a potential game-changer for coverage

# Lesson 2.3 — Tirzepatide Deep Dive (Zepbound & Mounjaro)

## Learner level
- Provider learning specific medication details
- Comparing to semaglutide knowledge

## Time + format
- Time: 20 min
- Format: Video lecture + efficacy graphs

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Explain why tirzepatide is called a "twincretin" or dual agonist
2. State mean weight loss outcomes from SURMOUNT-1 (%, kg)
3. Recite the tirzepatide dose escalation schedule
4. Compare tirzepatide efficacy to semaglutide

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient heard tirzepatide causes more weight loss than semaglutide. Is that true? Let's examine the evidence."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 1.3: GLP-1 and GIP physiology
- Lesson 2.2: Semaglutide overview

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Pharmacology (the "twincretin")
- **Mechanism:** Dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist
- **GIP contribution:** Unclear exact role, but combination appears synergistic for weight loss
- **Structure:** Novel synthetic peptide (not modified GLP-1)
- **Half-life:** ~5 days (once-weekly dosing)
- **Administration:** Subcutaneous injection, once weekly

### Chunk 2 — SURMOUNT program efficacy highlights
| Trial | Population | Dose | Mean Weight Loss (%) | % Achieving ≥5% |
|-------|------------|------|---------------------|-----------------|
| SURMOUNT-1 | Obesity w/o T2DM | 15 mg | -20.9% | 91% |
| SURMOUNT-1 | Obesity w/o T2DM | 10 mg | -19.5% | 89% |
| SURMOUNT-2 | Obesity + T2DM | 15 mg | -14.7% | 82% |
| SURMOUNT-3 | + intensive lifestyle | 15 mg | -26.6% | 96% |

- SURMOUNT-1: 1 in 3 patients achieved ≥25% weight loss at highest dose
- First AOM to show >20% mean weight loss in pivotal trials

### Chunk 3 — Dose escalation
| Weeks | Dose |
|-------|------|
| 1-4 | 2.5 mg |
| 5-8 | 5 mg |
| 9-12 | 7.5 mg (optional) |
| 13-16 | 10 mg |
| 17-20 | 12.5 mg (optional) |
| 21+ | 15 mg (max maintenance) |

- Pen strengths: 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15 mg
- Maintenance can be 5, 10, or 15 mg based on tolerability/response
- Same escalation for Zepbound and Mounjaro

### Chunk 4 — Tirzepatide vs Semaglutide (SURPASS-2)
| Metric | Tirzepatide 15 mg | Semaglutide 1 mg |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| A1c reduction | -2.3% | -1.9% |
| Weight loss | -12.4 kg | -6.2 kg |

- Note: SURPASS-2 used Ozempic 1 mg (not Wegovy 2.4 mg) — not a true "max dose vs max dose" comparison
- Head-to-head obesity trial (tirzepatide vs semaglutide 2.4 mg) ongoing

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Graph: SURMOUNT-1 weight loss by dose over 72 weeks
- Comparison table: Tirzepatide vs semaglutide efficacy

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- **Oral contraceptive interaction:** Recommend barrier method for 4 weeks after initiation and each dose escalation
- "20% weight loss" = ~50 lbs for a 250 lb patient
- Higher doses (12.5-15 mg) show incrementally better efficacy but more GI side effects

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What was the mean percent weight loss with tirzepatide 15 mg in SURMOUNT-1?
   - **Answer:** -20.9%
   - **Rationale:** This made tirzepatide the first AOM to achieve >20% mean weight loss
   - **Source:** Jastreboff AM et al. NEJM 2022

2. **Question:** What unique drug interaction exists with tirzepatide that doesn't apply to semaglutide?
   - **Answer:** Reduced efficacy of oral contraceptives for 4 weeks after initiation/escalation
   - **Rationale:** Delayed gastric emptying may reduce absorption of oral contraceptives
   - **Source:** Zepbound/Mounjaro prescribing information

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist with the highest weight loss efficacy of approved AOMs
- SURMOUNT-1 showed 20.9% mean weight loss; 1/3 of patients lost ≥25%
- Unique consideration: oral contraceptive interaction requires backup method during titration

# Lesson 2.4 — Head-to-Head Comparison & Trial Data

## Learner level
- Provider synthesizing medication knowledge
- Clinical decision-making focus

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + comparison tables

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Compare weight loss efficacy of semaglutide vs tirzepatide (with caveats)
2. Compare GI adverse effect profiles
3. Identify factors favoring one medication over the other
4. Explain why direct head-to-head data at max obesity doses is limited

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "A patient asks: 'Which one is better — Wegovy or Zepbound?' How do you answer based on evidence?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 2.2 and 2.3: Individual medication deep dives

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Efficacy comparison (cross-trial, with caveats)
| Metric | Semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP 1) | Tirzepatide 15 mg (SURMOUNT-1) |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mean weight loss | -14.9% | -20.9% |
| ≥5% responders | 86% | 91% |
| ≥10% responders | 69% | 81% |
| ≥20% responders | 32% | 57% |

**Caveat:** These are different trials with different populations — not head-to-head.

### Chunk 2 — SURPASS-2 (only direct comparison, but different context)
- **Design:** Tirzepatide (5/10/15 mg) vs semaglutide 1 mg in T2DM
- **Result:** Tirzepatide 15 mg: -12.4 kg vs semaglutide 1 mg: -6.2 kg
- **Limitation:** Ozempic 1 mg (diabetes dose), not Wegovy 2.4 mg (obesity dose)
- **Ongoing:** SURPASS-CVOT and dedicated obesity head-to-head trials

### Chunk 3 — Adverse effect comparison
| AE | Semaglutide | Tirzepatide |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| Nausea | 44% | 31% |
| Diarrhea | 30% | 23% |
| Vomiting | 24% | 12% |
| Constipation | 24% | 17% |

- Tirzepatide may have slightly better GI tolerability at equivalent efficacy
- Both: GI AEs typically peak during escalation, improve at maintenance

### Chunk 4 — Factors guiding selection
**Favor semaglutide:**
- Established CV benefit (SELECT trial — 20% MACE reduction)
- Patient with known ASCVD or high CV risk
- Insurance coverage (may be more available)
- More prescriber experience/familiarity

**Favor tirzepatide:**
- Higher weight loss goal (>15% target)
- GI-sensitive patient (potentially better tolerability)
- T2DM with inadequate control on semaglutide
- Patient preference or prior semaglutide non-response

**Either:**
- Cost/coverage often the deciding factor
- Both highly effective vs older AOMs

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Side-by-side bar graph: Weight loss by agent
- Decision flowchart: Semaglutide vs tirzepatide selection

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Until head-to-head max-dose obesity trial publishes, cross-trial comparisons are imperfect
- SELECT trial gives semaglutide a unique CV indication advantage
- "Start with what's available and affordable" is often the practical answer

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Why can't we definitively say tirzepatide is "better" than semaglutide from current data?
   - **Answer:** No head-to-head trial at maximum obesity doses (2.4 mg vs 15 mg) has been completed
   - **Rationale:** SURPASS-2 compared tirzepatide to Ozempic 1 mg (not the obesity dose)
   - **Source:** Frías JP et al. NEJM 2021

2. **Question:** Which medication has proven cardiovascular outcome benefit in obesity?
   - **Answer:** Semaglutide (SELECT trial)
   - **Rationale:** 20% reduction in MACE; tirzepatide CV outcomes trial ongoing
   - **Source:** Lincoff AM et al. NEJM 2023

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Cross-trial data suggests tirzepatide may produce greater weight loss, but head-to-head confirmation is pending
- Semaglutide has proven CV benefit (SELECT); tirzepatide CVOT is ongoing
- Practical selection often depends on coverage, availability, and patient-specific factors

# Lesson 2.5 — Pipeline Agents (Retatrutide, Orforglipron, Amycretin)

## Learner level
- Provider staying current with emerging therapies
- Awareness-level (not prescribing knowledge)

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video overview

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Name three investigational incretin-based agents and their mechanisms
2. Explain why glucagon receptor agonism may enhance weight loss
3. Discuss the clinical significance of oral GLP-1 RA formulations
4. Set appropriate expectations for when these agents may become available

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient read about a 'triple hormone' drug that causes 25%+ weight loss. What can you tell them?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 2.1-2.4: Current approved agents

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Retatrutide (Eli Lilly)
- **Mechanism:** Triple agonist — GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon receptor
- **Glucagon rationale:** Increases energy expenditure, hepatic lipid oxidation
- **Phase 2 data (NEJM 2023):**
  - 48 weeks, highest dose (12 mg): -24.2% mean weight loss
  - 91% achieved ≥15% weight loss
  - GI AEs similar to other incretins
- **Status:** Phase 3 trials ongoing (TRIUMPH program)
- **Projected availability:** ~2026-2027 if approved

### Chunk 2 — Orforglipron (Eli Lilly)
- **Mechanism:** Oral, non-peptide GLP-1 receptor agonist
- **Significance:** First oral small-molecule GLP-1 RA (not peptide like Rybelsus)
- **Phase 2 data:**
  - 36 weeks: up to -14.7% weight loss
  - Daily oral dosing
- **Advantages:** No injection, potentially better adherence
- **Status:** Phase 3 ongoing
- **Note:** Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) exists but has lower bioavailability and is approved only for T2DM

### Chunk 3 — Amycretin (Novo Nordisk)
- **Mechanism:** GLP-1 + Amylin co-agonist
- **Amylin rationale:** Complements GLP-1 satiety effects (synergy)
- **Early data:** Phase 1 showed promising weight loss (up to -13% at 12 weeks)
- **Status:** Early clinical development
- **Timeframe:** Several years from potential approval

### Chunk 4 — Clinical implications
- Pipeline validates incretin class as the future of obesity treatment
- Multiple mechanisms being explored (dual, triple, oral, combinations)
- Patients may ask about "what's next" — be prepared to discuss realistically
- Current agents (semaglutide, tirzepatide) remain standard of care for now

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Pipeline agents comparison (mechanism, phase, key data)
- Timeline: Expected approval horizons

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Retatrutide's triple agonism may achieve 25%+ weight loss — approaching surgical outcomes
- Oral agents could remove injection barrier, expanding access
- "Watch this space" — obesity pharmacotherapy is rapidly evolving

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What three receptors does retatrutide target?
   - **Answer:** GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors
   - **Rationale:** Triple agonism may produce superior weight loss via complementary mechanisms
   - **Source:** Jastreboff AM et al. NEJM 2023

2. **Question:** What makes orforglipron different from oral semaglutide (Rybelsus)?
   - **Answer:** Orforglipron is a non-peptide small molecule (not requiring absorption enhancers)
   - **Rationale:** May allow more flexible dosing and better bioavailability
   - **Source:** Eli Lilly press releases; phase 2 data presentations

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Retatrutide (triple agonist) showed ~24% weight loss in phase 2 — potentially best-in-class
- Oral GLP-1 RAs (orforglipron) may eliminate injection barrier
- Current approved agents remain standard of care; pipeline drugs are 1-3+ years away
