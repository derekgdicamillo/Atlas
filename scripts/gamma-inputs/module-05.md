# Lesson 5.1 — Adverse Effect Overview (Incidence & Time Course)

## Learner level
- Provider learning safety profile
- Setting expectations for patient counseling

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + incidence tables

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Cite incidence rates for common GI adverse effects
2. Explain when AEs typically peak and improve
3. Compare semaglutide and tirzepatide tolerability

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient wants to know: 'What side effects should I expect, and will they go away?' Here's what the data shows."

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 02: Medication overview
- Module 04: Dosing and titration

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Most common adverse effects (both agents)
| Adverse Effect | Semaglutide (STEP 1) | Tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-1) |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Nausea | 44% | 31% |
| Diarrhea | 30% | 23% |
| Vomiting | 24% | 12% |
| Constipation | 24% | 17% |
| Abdominal pain | 20% | 14% |
| Headache | 14% | 11% |
| Fatigue | 11% | 9% |
| Injection site reaction | 3-5% | 3-5% |

**Key point:** GI symptoms are by far the most common

### Chunk 2 — Time course of GI adverse effects
- **Onset:** Typically within first 1-2 weeks at a new dose
- **Peak:** During dose escalation phase (first 16-20 weeks)
- **Improvement:** Usually diminish at stable maintenance dose
- **Resolution:** Most patients have significant improvement by week 20

**Pattern:** "Worst when changing doses, better when stable"

### Chunk 3 — Semaglutide vs tirzepatide tolerability
- Tirzepatide appears to have modestly lower GI AE rates in trials
- No head-to-head tolerability comparison at equivalent efficacy
- Individual variation is high — some patients tolerate one better than the other
- Both: most discontinue due to GI AEs do so during escalation, not maintenance

### Chunk 4 — Less common but notable AEs
- **Gallbladder events:** 1-2% (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis)
- **Acute pancreatitis:** ~0.2-0.3%
- **Hypoglycemia:** Rare unless on insulin/sulfonylurea
- **Injection site reactions:** Usually mild, self-limited
- **Heart rate increase:** Small (2-4 bpm) — clinical significance unclear

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: AE incidence comparison (semaglutide vs tirzepatide)
- Graph: GI symptom severity over time (peak during escalation, improvement at maintenance)

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "GI symptoms are common but usually manageable and time-limited"
- Setting expectations upfront improves adherence
- Patients who make it through titration usually tolerate maintenance well

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What is the most common adverse effect of GLP-1 RAs?
   - **Answer:** Nausea
   - **Rationale:** Reported in 30-44% of patients; typically improves with time
   - **Source:** STEP and SURMOUNT trials

2. **Question:** When are GI side effects typically worst?
   - **Answer:** During dose escalation (first 16-20 weeks)
   - **Rationale:** New doses trigger symptoms; stabilization at maintenance improves tolerability
   - **Source:** Clinical trial time course data

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- GI symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation) are most common, affecting 20-40%+
- Symptoms peak during escalation and typically improve at maintenance
- Tirzepatide may have slightly better GI tolerability, but individual variation exists

# Lesson 5.2 — Nausea & Vomiting Management Algorithm

## Learner level
- Provider managing symptomatic patients
- Practical algorithm focus

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + algorithm

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Apply lifestyle/dietary interventions for mild nausea
2. Select appropriate antiemetics for moderate symptoms
3. Adjust therapy when conservative measures fail

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient is 2 weeks into semaglutide and can barely eat due to nausea. How do you get them through this?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 5.1: AE overview

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Step 1: Lifestyle/dietary modifications (mild symptoms)
- **Eat smaller, more frequent meals** (5-6 small meals vs 3 large)
- **Avoid high-fat, greasy, or fried foods** (slow gastric emptying worse with fat)
- **Avoid lying down after eating** (30-60 minutes upright)
- **Stay hydrated** (small sips throughout the day)
- **Bland foods:** crackers, toast, rice, bananas, applesauce
- **Ginger:** tea, candies, or supplements (modest evidence)
- **Avoid strong smells** that trigger nausea

### Chunk 2 — Step 2: Add antiemetic PRN (moderate symptoms)
**First-line:**
- **Ondansetron (Zofran) 4-8 mg PO/ODT q8h PRN**
  - 5-HT3 antagonist; well-tolerated
  - Can cause constipation (may compound GLP-1 effect)

**Alternatives:**
- **Promethazine (Phenergan) 12.5-25 mg PO/PR q6h PRN**
  - Sedating; good for severe nausea with vomiting
- **Metoclopramide (Reglan) 5-10 mg PO before meals**
  - Prokinetic; may counteract delayed gastric emptying
  - Use short-term only (tardive dyskinesia risk)
- **Meclizine 25 mg PO q6h PRN**
  - If nausea has vestibular component

### Chunk 3 — Step 3: Dose adjustment (persistent symptoms)
If symptoms persist >2 weeks despite antiemetics:
1. **Extend time at current dose** (4 → 6-8 weeks)
2. **Use intermediate doses** (tirzepatide 7.5 or 12.5 mg)
3. **Consider dose reduction** if at higher doses
4. **Temporarily hold** if unable to maintain oral intake

### Chunk 4 — Step 4: When to discontinue
**Red flags requiring stop and evaluate:**
- Persistent vomiting (>24-48 hours)
- Signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness, low BP)
- Unable to keep down fluids
- Severe abdominal pain (r/o pancreatitis)
- Weight loss >3 lbs/week

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Nausea management algorithm (4 steps)
- Table: Antiemetic options with dosing

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Front-load the counseling" — dietary guidance at initiation prevents many issues
- Ondansetron ODT is convenient; constipation is a trade-off
- Most patients improve — encourage persistence through the first few weeks

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What's the first-line antiemetic for GLP-1-induced nausea?
   - **Answer:** Ondansetron (Zofran) 4-8 mg PRN
   - **Rationale:** Effective, well-tolerated, minimal interactions
   - **Source:** Clinical practice; extrapolated from chemotherapy-induced nausea evidence

2. **Question:** When should you hold GLP-1 therapy for nausea?
   - **Answer:** If patient cannot maintain adequate oral fluid intake or has signs of dehydration
   - **Rationale:** Dehydration can lead to AKI and other complications
   - **Source:** Clinical judgment; FDA label warnings

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Lifestyle modifications are first-line for mild nausea (smaller meals, avoid fat, stay upright)
- Ondansetron is the go-to antiemetic; use short-term and PRN
- Persistent symptoms warrant dose adjustment; severe symptoms require hold and evaluation

# Lesson 5.3 — Constipation Management Algorithm

## Learner level
- Provider managing symptomatic patients
- Practical algorithm focus

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture + algorithm

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Explain why GLP-1 RAs cause constipation
2. Apply first-line interventions (fiber, fluids, activity)
3. Select appropriate laxatives and escalate as needed

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient reports no bowel movement in 5 days since starting Zepbound. What's your approach?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 5.1: AE overview (constipation affects ~20% of patients)

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Mechanism
- GLP-1 RAs slow gastric emptying and GI transit
- Reduced food intake → less stool bulk
- Decreased fluid intake (if eating less) compounds the problem
- Ondansetron (for nausea) can worsen constipation

### Chunk 2 — Step 1: Lifestyle interventions
- **Hydration:** ≥64 oz water daily (more if low intake)
- **Fiber:** Gradual increase to 25-30g/day (psyllium, vegetables, fruits)
- **Activity:** Regular movement/walking promotes motility
- **Timing:** Establish regular bowel routine (post-meal)

### Chunk 3 — Step 2: Add osmotic laxative
**First-line:**
- **Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)** 17g daily in water
  - Draws water into colon; well-tolerated
  - Can use daily for prevention

**Alternatives:**
- **Magnesium citrate** (if acute, short-term use)
- **Lactulose** (good option if available)

### Chunk 4 — Step 3: Escalate if needed
If osmotic laxative insufficient:
- **Add stimulant laxative PRN:**
  - Senna (Senokot) 8.6-17.2 mg at bedtime
  - Bisacodyl 5-10 mg at bedtime
  - Use intermittently, not daily long-term

**If still refractory:**
- Consider stool softener (docusate) — modest benefit
- Evaluate for obstruction if severe (imaging, exam)
- Consider dose reduction of GLP-1 RA

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Constipation management algorithm
- Table: Laxative options with mechanisms and dosing

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Proactive fiber and fluids prevent most cases"
- MiraLAX is safe for daily use during GLP-1 therapy
- Patients on ondansetron for nausea often get constipated — address both

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What's the first-line laxative for GLP-1-induced constipation?
   - **Answer:** Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)
   - **Rationale:** Osmotic mechanism, safe for daily use, well-tolerated
   - **Source:** Clinical practice guidelines

2. **Question:** How does GLP-1 RA therapy cause constipation?
   - **Answer:** Slowed GI transit, reduced food/fluid intake, delayed gastric emptying
   - **Rationale:** Multiple mechanisms contribute
   - **Source:** GLP-1 RA mechanism of action

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- GLP-1 RAs slow gut transit → constipation in ~20% of patients
- First-line: hydration, fiber, activity; add MiraLAX if needed
- Stimulant laxatives are second-line; refractory cases may need dose reduction

## Sources
- Clinical practice recommendations.
- AGA guidelines on constipation management.

# Lesson 5.4 — Diarrhea & Other GI Issues

## Learner level
- Provider managing GI complaints
- Practical management focus

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Apply management strategies for GLP-1-induced diarrhea
2. Address bloating, gas, and dyspepsia
3. Identify GI symptoms requiring further workup

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient has loose stools 3-4 times daily since starting tirzepatide. Is this expected, and what can you do?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 5.1: AE overview

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Diarrhea management
**Mechanism:** GLP-1 effects on GI motility are complex; some patients have accelerated transit
**Incidence:** 20-30% (usually mild to moderate)

**Management:**
1. **Reassurance:** Often improves within 2-4 weeks at stable dose
2. **Hydration:** Replace fluid losses (oral rehydration, electrolytes)
3. **Dietary adjustments:**
   - Avoid high-fat foods (can worsen)
   - Limit artificial sweeteners (sorbitol, etc.)
   - BRAT diet temporarily (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast)
4. **Loperamide (Imodium):** 2 mg after each loose stool, max 8 mg/day
   - Use PRN, not prophylactically
5. **Dose adjustment:** If persistent and affecting quality of life

### Chunk 2 — Bloating, gas, and dyspepsia
- **Common:** Delayed gastric emptying → early satiety, bloating
- **Management:**
  - Smaller, more frequent meals
  - Avoid carbonated beverages
  - Peppermint tea (carminative)
  - Simethicone PRN for gas

**GERD/Reflux:**
- Can occur (increased intragastric pressure)
- Avoid lying down after meals
- PPI or H2 blocker if bothersome

### Chunk 3 — Abdominal pain — when to worry
**Expected:** Mild cramping, especially during dose escalation
**Concerning (investigate):**
- Severe, persistent epigastric pain → pancreatitis
- RUQ pain, especially postprandial → gallbladder
- Pain with fever, jaundice → biliary pathology
- Pain with distension, no flatus → obstruction

**Workup if concerning:**
- Lipase, LFTs, RUQ ultrasound
- Hold GLP-1 RA pending evaluation

### Chunk 4 — Gastroparesis consideration
- GLP-1 RAs can unmask or worsen pre-existing gastroparesis
- If symptoms suggest (severe bloating, early satiety, vomiting undigested food):
  - Consider GI referral
  - May need to discontinue GLP-1 therapy
  - Avoid in known severe gastroparesis

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: GI symptom management quick reference
- Red flags checklist: When GI symptoms need workup

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Most diarrhea is self-limited; loperamide PRN is usually sufficient
- Severe abdominal pain is never "expected" — evaluate for pancreatitis/gallbladder
- Pre-existing GERD may worsen; optimize PPI therapy

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What's the max daily dose of loperamide for GLP-1-induced diarrhea?
   - **Answer:** 8 mg/day
   - **Rationale:** Standard OTC dosing; excessive use can cause constipation and electrolyte issues
   - **Source:** Standard prescribing references

2. **Question:** When should you suspect pancreatitis in a patient on a GLP-1 RA?
   - **Answer:** Severe, persistent epigastric pain, especially radiating to back
   - **Rationale:** Requires immediate evaluation (lipase, imaging) and holding therapy
   - **Source:** FDA label warnings

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Diarrhea usually improves with time; hydration and loperamide PRN are first-line
- Bloating and dyspepsia respond to smaller meals and simethicone
- Severe abdominal pain is a red flag — always evaluate for pancreatitis or gallbladder disease

# Lesson 5.5 — Serious Adverse Effects (Pancreatitis, Gallbladder, Hypoglycemia)

## Learner level
- Provider recognizing urgent complications
- Safety-critical content

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + red flag recognition

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Recognize clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis
2. Manage gallbladder complications (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis)
3. Adjust concurrent diabetes medications to prevent hypoglycemia

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient on Wegovy calls with severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. What's your immediate concern?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 03: Precautions
- Module 04: Dosing

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Acute pancreatitis
**Incidence:** ~0.2-0.3% in trials (rare but serious)

**Presentation:**
- Severe, persistent epigastric pain (often radiating to back)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Worse after eating
- May have fever, tachycardia if severe

**Management:**
1. **Immediate:** Stop GLP-1 RA
2. **Workup:** Serum lipase (↑3x ULN confirms); CT if diagnosis unclear
3. **Treatment:** NPO, IV fluids, pain management, hospitalize if moderate-severe
4. **After resolution:** Do not re-challenge with any GLP-1 RA

**Counseling:** "Call immediately for severe abdominal pain"

### Chunk 2 — Gallbladder complications
**Incidence:** ~2-3x increased risk of cholelithiasis/cholecystitis

**Mechanism:**
- Rapid weight loss → bile supersaturation → gallstone formation
- Not unique to GLP-1 RAs — any rapid weight loss increases risk

**Presentation:**
- RUQ pain, especially postprandial (fatty meals)
- May have nausea, bloating
- Cholecystitis: fever, persistent pain, Murphy's sign

**Management:**
1. **Suspected gallstones:** RUQ ultrasound
2. **Symptomatic cholelithiasis:** GI/surgery referral; may continue GLP-1 if managed
3. **Acute cholecystitis:** Hospitalization, surgery evaluation, hold GLP-1 RA
4. **Post-cholecystectomy:** Can resume GLP-1 therapy safely

**Counseling:** "Tell us about any RUQ pain, especially after eating"

### Chunk 3 — Hypoglycemia
**Risk:** Low with GLP-1 RA monotherapy (glucose-dependent insulin release)

**High risk situations:**
- Concurrent insulin therapy
- Concurrent sulfonylurea (glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride)
- Fasting or very low calorie intake

**Prevention:**
- **Reduce insulin dose by 20-25%** when starting GLP-1 RA in T2DM patients
- **Reduce or stop sulfonylurea** (consider discontinuation)
- Educate on hypoglycemia symptoms (sweating, tremor, confusion)
- Provide glucose tablets or juice for rescue

**Management if hypoglycemia occurs:**
- Treat with fast-acting carbohydrate (15g rule)
- Reassess concurrent medication doses
- Document and adjust regimen

### Chunk 4 — Other rare serious events
- **Acute kidney injury (AKI):** From dehydration (severe GI symptoms) — ensure hydration
- **Injection site reactions:** Rarely severe; most mild and self-limited
- **Allergic reactions:** Rare; discontinue if significant
- **Suicidal ideation:** FDA investigating signal; screen patients with mood disorders

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Serious AE recognition and management
- Flowchart: Abdominal pain evaluation in GLP-1 patients

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Pancreatitis: stop immediately and don't re-challenge
- Gallstones: manage the stones, can often continue GLP-1 after resolution
- Always reduce insulin/SU when starting GLP-1 in diabetics — don't wait for hypo

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Can you re-challenge with a GLP-1 RA after an episode of acute pancreatitis?
   - **Answer:** No — pancreatitis is a contraindication to re-challenge
   - **Rationale:** Risk of recurrence; use alternative AOM
   - **Source:** FDA label; clinical consensus

2. **Question:** How should you adjust insulin when adding a GLP-1 RA in a T2DM patient?
   - **Answer:** Reduce insulin dose by 20-25% at initiation
   - **Rationale:** GLP-1 RA improves glycemia; continuing full insulin dose risks hypoglycemia
   - **Source:** ADA guidelines; FDA label

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Pancreatitis is rare but serious — stop GLP-1 immediately if suspected; no re-challenge
- Gallbladder complications relate to rapid weight loss; manage surgically if needed, can often continue therapy
- Reduce insulin and sulfonylureas when starting GLP-1 RA in diabetics to prevent hypoglycemia

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture + handout template

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Deliver key counseling points at treatment initiation
2. Provide actionable self-management instructions
3. Clearly communicate when to contact the office vs seek urgent care

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "The first injection is a teaching moment. What do you say to set your patient up for success?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Module 05 lessons 5.1-5.5: AE management

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Anticipatory guidance script
**At initiation, cover:**
1. "Side effects are common but usually manageable"
2. "Nausea, upset stomach, and changes in bowel habits are expected"
3. "Symptoms typically peak when we increase your dose and improve over time"
4. "Let's talk about what you can do at home to minimize these"

### Chunk 2 — Dietary counseling (give written instructions)
- **Eat smaller, more frequent meals** (5-6/day instead of 2-3 large)
- **Prioritize protein** (prevents muscle loss, improves satiety)
- **Avoid high-fat, greasy, fried foods** (make nausea worse)
- **Stay hydrated** (at least 64 oz water daily; more if vomiting/diarrhea)
- **Add fiber gradually** (prevents constipation)
- **Avoid lying down for 30-60 minutes after eating**

### Chunk 3 — Self-management instructions
**For nausea:**
- Try ginger tea or candies
- Bland foods (crackers, toast)
- Over-the-counter Emetrol if mild
- Use prescribed ondansetron if moderate

**For constipation:**
- MiraLAX daily is OK
- Increase fiber and water

**For diarrhea:**
- Stay hydrated (oral rehydration)
- Imodium 2 mg after each loose stool (max 8 mg/day)

### Chunk 4 — When to call vs. seek urgent care
**Call the office:**
- Nausea lasting >2 weeks despite interventions
- Unable to eat enough to function
- Weight loss >3 lbs/week
- Persistent constipation or diarrhea not responding to OTC measures

**Seek urgent care / ER:**
- Severe abdominal pain (especially upper/epigastric)
- Persistent vomiting (can't keep fluids down >24 hours)
- Signs of dehydration (dizziness, dark urine, confusion)
- Symptoms of low blood sugar (if on insulin/SU): sweating, shakiness, confusion

### Chunk 5 — Provide written materials
- Patient handout summarizing the above
- List of recommended foods and foods to avoid
- Contact information for questions
- Link to manufacturer patient support resources

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Patient handout template (1-page)

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Front-loaded education prevents ER visits"
- Written instructions > verbal alone — patients forget
- Empowerment: "You have tools to manage this; we're here for questions"

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Why is protein prioritization important during GLP-1 therapy?
   - **Answer:** Reduced appetite can lead to inadequate protein intake, risking muscle loss
   - **Rationale:** Preserving lean mass is critical for metabolic health
   - **Source:** Obesity nutrition guidelines

2. **Question:** What symptom warrants immediate urgent care evaluation?
   - **Answer:** Severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting >24 hours, or signs of dehydration
   - **Rationale:** May indicate pancreatitis, obstruction, or dehydration requiring IV fluids
   - **Source:** Clinical safety guidance

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Proactive counseling at initiation prevents complications and improves adherence
- Provide written dietary and self-management instructions patients can reference
- Clearly define when to call vs. seek urgent care — empowers appropriate response
