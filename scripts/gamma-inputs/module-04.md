# Lesson 4.1 — Semaglutide Dosing & Titration Protocol

## Learner level
- Prescribers initiating GLP-1 therapy
- Assumes familiarity with semaglutide mechanism and indications

## Time + format
- Time: 20 min
- Format: Video lecture + dosing reference card

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State the complete FDA titration schedule for Wegovy (chronic weight management)
2. State the complete FDA titration schedule for Ozempic (T2DM)
3. Explain the rationale for gradual dose escalation (GI tolerability)
4. Identify patients who may benefit from extended titration intervals

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient started Wegovy at 0.5 mg because they 'wanted faster results' — now they have severe nausea and want to stop. How could this have been prevented?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Understanding of GLP-1 receptor agonist mechanism
- Familiarity with delayed gastric emptying as key effect
- Recognition of nausea as dose-limiting adverse effect

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Wegovy (semaglutide for chronic weight management)

#### FDA-Approved Titration Schedule
| Week | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1–4 | 0.25 mg weekly | Initiation (not therapeutic for weight loss) |
| 5–8 | 0.5 mg weekly | First dose increase |
| 9–12 | 1.0 mg weekly | Continue escalation |
| 13–16 | 1.7 mg weekly | Approaching maintenance |
| 17+ | 2.4 mg weekly | **Maintenance dose** |

#### Key Points
- 0.25 mg is for tolerability adaptation only — no significant weight loss expected
- Each dose is maintained for 4 weeks before escalation
- If 2.4 mg not tolerated, 1.7 mg is acceptable maintenance
- Total titration period: 16 weeks to reach full dose

### Chunk 2 — Ozempic (semaglutide for T2DM)

#### FDA-Approved Titration Schedule
| Week | Dose | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1–4 | 0.25 mg weekly | Initiation (not for glycemic control) |
| 5+ | 0.5 mg weekly | First therapeutic dose |
| 9+ | 1.0 mg weekly | If additional control needed |
| 13+ | 2.0 mg weekly | Maximum dose (if needed) |

#### Key Points
- 0.5 mg is the first dose that provides glycemic benefit
- Most patients achieve adequate control at 0.5 or 1.0 mg
- 2.0 mg available for patients needing additional glycemic control
- Weight loss typically greater at higher doses

### Chunk 3 — Why gradual titration matters

#### Physiologic rationale
- Semaglutide delays gastric emptying → nausea, early satiety, vomiting
- GI tract adaptation occurs over 4–8 weeks at each dose
- Rapid escalation overwhelms adaptive mechanisms

#### Clinical evidence
- STEP trials used 16-week titration; ~44% still reported nausea but few discontinued
- Real-world experience: rushing titration increases dropout rates
- Slower titration = better long-term adherence and outcomes

### Chunk 4 — Extended titration scenarios

#### Consider 8-week (instead of 4-week) intervals when:
- Patient has history of GI sensitivity
- Moderate-severe nausea persists at current dose
- Patient is elderly or has multiple comorbidities
- Renal impairment (increased AKI risk with dehydration)

#### Consider holding escalation when:
- Patient has active nausea/vomiting not controlled with supportive measures
- Recent GI illness or dehydration
- Achieving satisfactory results at current dose
- Patient preference for slower approach

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- **Figure 1**: Side-by-side Wegovy vs Ozempic titration ladder
- **Table**: Extended titration decision guide (when to slow)

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Start low, go slow — the 0.25 mg dose isn't about weight loss, it's about GI training"
- "If a patient can't tolerate 2.4 mg, staying at 1.7 mg is FDA-approved and still effective"
- "The titration schedule is a minimum interval, not a requirement — extending is always okay"
- "Patients who rush titration often quit; patients who go slow often succeed"

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)

### Question 1
**A patient on Wegovy 1.0 mg for 4 weeks has mild nausea but is tolerating the medication. What is the appropriate next step?**

A) Increase to 1.7 mg as scheduled  
B) Extend 1.0 mg for another 4 weeks  
C) Decrease to 0.5 mg  
D) Discontinue therapy  

**Answer:** A) Increase to 1.7 mg as scheduled

**Rationale:** Mild, tolerable nausea is expected and typically resolves. The FDA titration schedule should be followed if symptoms are manageable. Extended titration is reserved for moderate-severe symptoms.

### Question 2
**What is the maintenance dose of Wegovy for chronic weight management?**

A) 1.0 mg weekly  
B) 1.7 mg weekly  
C) 2.0 mg weekly  
D) 2.4 mg weekly  

**Answer:** D) 2.4 mg weekly

**Rationale:** Per FDA labeling, 2.4 mg weekly is the target maintenance dose for Wegovy (chronic weight management). 1.7 mg is an acceptable alternative if 2.4 mg is not tolerated.

### Question 3
**Which patient would benefit most from extended 8-week titration intervals?**

A) 35-year-old with no comorbidities  
B) 72-year-old with CKD stage 3 and prior GI intolerance to metformin  
C) 45-year-old requesting rapid weight loss  
D) 50-year-old with well-controlled hypertension  

**Answer:** B) 72-year-old with CKD stage 3 and prior GI intolerance to metformin

**Rationale:** Age, renal impairment, and history of GI sensitivity are all factors favoring slower titration. CKD patients are at higher risk for AKI if dehydration occurs from GI side effects.

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
1. **Wegovy titration**: 0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 → 1.7 → 2.4 mg (4 weeks each; 16 weeks total)
2. **Ozempic titration**: 0.25 → 0.5 → 1.0 → 2.0 mg (escalate based on glycemic response)
3. **Principle**: The initiation dose (0.25 mg) is for GI adaptation, not therapeutic effect — never skip it

# Lesson 4.2 — Tirzepatide Dosing & Titration Protocol

## Learner level
- Provider ready to prescribe
- Comparison to semaglutide knowledge

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + reference table

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State the tirzepatide dose escalation schedule
2. Identify which dose steps are "optional"
3. Understand that Zepbound and Mounjaro use the same escalation

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Tirzepatide has more dose steps than semaglutide. Which ones can you skip, and when should you not?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lesson 2.3: Tirzepatide overview
- Lesson 4.1: Semaglutide dosing (for comparison)

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Tirzepatide dose escalation (FDA-approved schedule)
| Weeks | Dose | Step Type |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1-4 | 2.5 mg | Required |
| 5-8 | 5 mg | Required |
| 9-12 | 7.5 mg | Optional |
| 13-16 | 10 mg | Required |
| 17-20 | 12.5 mg | Optional |
| 21+ | 15 mg | Max maintenance |

- Maintenance dose can be 5, 10, or 15 mg based on tolerability and response
- Optional steps (7.5 mg, 12.5 mg) allow slower escalation if needed
- Escalation every 4 weeks minimum

### Chunk 2 — Pen configurations
| Dose | Pens per Box | Doses per Pen |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2.5 mg | 4 | 1 |
| 5 mg | 4 | 1 |
| 7.5 mg | 4 | 1 |
| 10 mg | 4 | 1 |
| 12.5 mg | 4 | 1 |
| 15 mg | 4 | 1 |

- Single-use prefilled pens
- Same configuration for Zepbound and Mounjaro

### Chunk 3 — Flexible maintenance dosing
**Per label:** Maintenance can be 5, 10, or 15 mg
- If tolerating well at 10 mg with good weight loss → can stay at 10 mg
- If weight loss plateauing at 10 mg and tolerating → escalate to 15 mg
- If 15 mg causes intolerance → can de-escalate to 10 mg or 12.5 mg

### Chunk 4 — Zepbound vs Mounjaro prescribing
- **Same molecule, same doses, same pens**
- **Zepbound:** Obesity indication
- **Mounjaro:** T2DM indication
- Check insurance: coverage may require indication-matched product
- Document appropriate diagnosis code (E66.x for obesity, E11.x for T2DM)

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Table: Escalation schedule with optional steps highlighted
- Side-by-side: Semaglutide vs tirzepatide escalation comparison

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- 7.5 mg and 12.5 mg are your "half-step" options for GI-sensitive patients
- Unlike Wegovy, maintenance isn't always max dose — 10 mg may be sufficient
- Oral contraceptive interaction: counsel on barrier method for 4 weeks after each escalation

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Which tirzepatide doses are optional escalation steps?
   - **Answer:** 7.5 mg and 12.5 mg
   - **Rationale:** Allow slower titration without deviating from label
   - **Source:** Zepbound/Mounjaro prescribing information

2. **Question:** Can a patient remain on tirzepatide 10 mg as a maintenance dose?
   - **Answer:** Yes — maintenance can be 5, 10, or 15 mg based on response/tolerability
   - **Rationale:** Flexibility allows individualization
   - **Source:** FDA label

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Tirzepatide escalation: 2.5 → 5 → (7.5) → 10 → (12.5) → 15 mg; 7.5 and 12.5 are optional
- Maintenance dose is flexible (5, 10, or 15 mg) — not always max dose
- Zepbound and Mounjaro are identical except indication; verify insurance requirements

## Sources
- Zepbound prescribing information (FDA label).
- Mounjaro prescribing information (FDA label).

# Lesson 4.3 — Tolerability-Guided Titration (Slowing & Adjusting)

## Learner level
- Provider managing real-world titration challenges
- Problem-solving focus

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture + case examples

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Identify signs that titration should be slowed
2. Apply specific strategies for common GI symptoms
3. Determine when to hold, reduce, or discontinue therapy

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient calls after starting 1.0 mg semaglutide — severe nausea, can't eat. Do you push through, slow down, or stop?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 4.1-4.2: Standard titration schedules

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — When to slow titration
**Red flags requiring titration pause:**
- Severe nausea/vomiting (affecting hydration or daily function)
- Unable to maintain adequate oral intake
- Weight loss >1.5 lbs/week (risk of gallstones, muscle loss)
- Patient distress/non-adherence due to symptoms

**Yellow flags (consider slowing):**
- Moderate nausea lasting >2 weeks at a dose
- Persistent constipation or diarrhea
- Patient expressing concern about tolerability

### Chunk 2 — Strategies for GI intolerance
| Symptom | Management |
|---------|------------|
| Nausea | Smaller meals, avoid high-fat foods, stay hydrated, consider ondansetron PRN |
| Vomiting | Hold dose if severe, resume when resolved, consider slower titration |
| Constipation | Fiber, hydration, MiraLAX PRN |
| Diarrhea | Hydration, consider Imodium if severe, usually self-limiting |

**Titration adjustments:**
- Extend current dose from 4 weeks to 6-8 weeks
- Use optional intermediate doses (tirzepatide 7.5 mg, 12.5 mg)
- Consider not reaching max dose if lower dose is effective and tolerated

### Chunk 3 — Dose reduction vs discontinuation
**Reduce dose if:**
- Intolerance at a specific dose but tolerated previous doses
- Patient wishes to continue therapy
- Weight loss is still occurring at lower dose

**Discontinue if:**
- Persistent severe symptoms despite dose reduction
- Signs of dehydration or malnutrition
- Suspected pancreatitis (stop immediately, evaluate)
- Patient no longer wishes to continue

### Chunk 4 — Documentation and follow-up
- Document the symptom, severity, and action taken
- Schedule closer follow-up during difficult titration (every 2 weeks)
- "We can always go slower — the goal is to find a dose that works for you"

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Titration decision tree based on tolerability
- Table: GI symptom management quick reference

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Go slow to go far" — patients who tolerate titration have better long-term adherence
- Many patients who struggle early can successfully reach maintenance with patience
- Max dose isn't always necessary — efficacy exists at lower doses too

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** A patient has moderate nausea at semaglutide 1.0 mg. What's your first adjustment?
   - **Answer:** Extend time at 1.0 mg (e.g., 6-8 weeks instead of 4) before escalating
   - **Rationale:** Allows adaptation; most patients improve with time
   - **Source:** Clinical practice; FDA label allows flexible titration

2. **Question:** When should you immediately discontinue a GLP-1 RA?
   - **Answer:** Suspected acute pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain)
   - **Rationale:** Safety concern; requires evaluation before any re-challenge
   - **Source:** FDA label; clinical guidelines

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Slow titration when GI symptoms affect function, hydration, or adherence
- Use intermediate doses and extended intervals to improve tolerability
- Max dose isn't mandatory — find the tolerated effective dose for each patient

## Sources
- Wegovy and Zepbound prescribing information.
- Clinical experience and practice guidelines.

# Lesson 4.4 — Missed Doses & Restart Rules

## Learner level
- Provider counseling patients on adherence
- Practical, rule-based

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture + quick reference

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. State the missed dose rule for weekly GLP-1 RAs
2. Know when to restart at a lower dose after extended gaps
3. Counsel patients on proactive missed dose management

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient calls: 'I forgot my shot on Tuesday and it's now Saturday. What do I do?'"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 4.1-4.2: Dosing schedules

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Missed dose rules (both agents)
**If dose is missed:**
- **≤48 hours late (both semaglutide and tirzepatide):**
  - Take the missed dose as soon as remembered
  - Resume regular schedule

- **>48 hours late but <2 weeks since last dose:**
  - Skip the missed dose
  - Take the next dose on the regular scheduled day
  - (Some clinical judgment: if close to next dose, just wait)

### Chunk 2 — Restart after extended gap
**Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic):**
- Gap >2 weeks: Consider restarting at 0.25 mg and re-titrating
- Rationale: GI tolerance may be lost; re-escalation reduces side effects

**Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro):**
- Gap >4 weeks: Consider restarting at 2.5 mg and re-titrating
- Same rationale: avoid severe GI symptoms from jumping back to high dose

**Clinical judgment applies:**
- Short gap (2-4 weeks) with prior good tolerance → may resume at same dose
- Longer gap or prior GI issues → re-titrate

### Chunk 3 — Counseling patients
**Proactive guidance:**
- "Pick a consistent day each week (e.g., Sunday evening)"
- "Set a phone reminder"
- "If you travel, bring your medication and a cooler pack"
- "If you miss by <2 days, take it right away; otherwise skip and wait for your next scheduled day"
- "Call us if you miss more than 2 weeks — we may need to restart at a lower dose"

### Chunk 4 — What NOT to do
- Do not take a double dose
- Do not take two doses in the same week to "catch up"
- Do not restart at maintenance dose after extended break (risk of severe GI symptoms)

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Flowchart: Missed dose decision tree
- Quick reference card: Missed dose rules for patient handout

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "48-hour rule" — easy to remember and counsel
- Patients often restart at high doses and suffer — prevent this with good counseling
- Travel is a common cause of missed doses — address proactively

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** A patient on tirzepatide 10 mg missed their dose by 3 days. What should they do?
   - **Answer:** Skip the missed dose and take the next dose on the regular scheduled day
   - **Rationale:** >48 hours late → skip; don't double up
   - **Source:** FDA labeling

2. **Question:** A patient hasn't taken semaglutide for 3 weeks. How should they restart?
   - **Answer:** Restart at 0.25 mg and re-titrate
   - **Rationale:** GI tolerance may be lost; re-escalation prevents severe nausea
   - **Source:** Clinical guidance; FDA label considerations

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- ≤48 hours late: take the dose; >48 hours: skip and resume schedule
- Extended gaps (>2-4 weeks) require restarting at the lowest dose and re-titrating
- Proactive counseling on missed doses prevents complications

# Lesson 4.5 — Drug Shortages & Switching Strategies

## Learner level
- Provider managing real-world supply issues
- Adaptive prescribing

## Time + format
- Time: 12 min
- Format: Video lecture + decision trees

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Identify current shortage patterns for GLP-1 RAs
2. Apply safe switching between semaglutide and tirzepatide
3. Discuss compounding as a shortage option (with caveats)

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient's pharmacy says Wegovy 1.7 mg is backordered for 6 weeks. What are your options?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 4.1-4.4: Dosing and titration

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Understanding the shortage landscape
- Demand far exceeds manufacturing capacity (as of 2024-2026)
- Intermittent shortages of specific dose strengths
- FDA shortage database: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/

**Common patterns:**
- Starter doses often available; higher doses more scarce
- Shortages vary by region and pharmacy
- Specialty pharmacies may have better supply

### Chunk 2 — Within-class switching (same product, dose adjustment)
**If specific dose unavailable:**
- **Option 1:** Use available lower dose with two pens
  - Example: Wegovy 1.7 mg unavailable → use two 0.5 mg + one 0.5 mg (total 1.5 mg)? No — doses aren't additive this way
  - Better: Stay at available lower dose until supply returns
- **Option 2:** Temporarily extend time at current dose
- **Option 3:** Switch to Ozempic (off-label) if semaglutide available in diabetes product

**Ozempic ↔ Wegovy:**
- Same molecule; different max doses and escalation
- Can switch if necessary, adjusting for available strengths

### Chunk 3 — Cross-class switching (semaglutide ↔ tirzepatide)
**No direct dose equivalence exists.** Approximate guidance:
| Semaglutide | Tirzepatide (approximate) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| 0.5 mg | 2.5-5 mg |
| 1.0 mg | 5 mg |
| 1.7 mg | 7.5-10 mg |
| 2.4 mg | 10-15 mg |

**Approach:**
- When switching, consider starting at a lower tirzepatide dose and titrating
- Monitor tolerability — GI effects may differ
- Document rationale for switch

### Chunk 4 — Compounding considerations
- Compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide exist during shortages
- FDA allows compounding when drug is on shortage list
- **Cautions:**
  - Quality varies by pharmacy
  - Not FDA-approved; different salts (e.g., semaglutide sodium vs acetate)
  - Some state restrictions
  - Requires patient counseling about differences
- Link to: [[Compounded GLP-1s - Regulatory Overview (US)]]

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Decision tree: Shortage management options
- Table: Approximate dose equivalence for switching

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "Something is better than nothing" — maintaining therapy at a lower dose beats stopping
- Check multiple pharmacies, including mail-order and specialty
- Compounding is an option but requires informed consent and careful sourcing

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Wegovy 2.4 mg is unavailable. Can the patient use Ozempic instead?
   - **Answer:** Yes, Ozempic can be used off-label (max 2.0 mg); lower max dose but same molecule
   - **Rationale:** Maintains therapy continuity during shortage
   - **Source:** Clinical practice; same active ingredient

2. **Question:** If switching from semaglutide 1.7 mg to tirzepatide, what dose would you consider?
   - **Answer:** Approximately 7.5-10 mg tirzepatide
   - **Rationale:** No direct equivalence; this is approximate; start conservatively
   - **Source:** Clinical guidance (no RCT data on switching)

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Drug shortages are common; have a plan for patients on GLP-1 RAs
- Within-class adjustments (lower dose, switch to diabetes product) are first-line
- Cross-class switching or compounding are options with appropriate counseling

## Sources
- FDA drug shortage database.
- Clinical consensus on switching (no formal guidelines exist).
- Compounding regulations: [[Compounded GLP-1s - Regulatory Overview (US)]].

# Lesson 4.6 — Injection Technique & Patient Education

## Learner level
- Provider teaching patients
- Practical demonstration focus

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video demonstration + checklist

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Demonstrate correct subcutaneous injection technique
2. Counsel patients on injection sites and rotation
3. Explain proper storage and handling

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "Your patient is needle-phobic and has never self-injected. How do you make the first injection as smooth as possible?"

## Prior knowledge checkpoint
- Lessons 4.1-4.2: Familiarity with pen devices

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Injection technique (step-by-step)
1. **Prepare:** Wash hands; gather supplies (pen, alcohol swab, sharps container)
2. **Inspect pen:** Check expiration, clarity (should be clear and colorless)
3. **Select site:** Abdomen (2 inches from navel), thigh, or upper arm
4. **Clean site:** Alcohol swab, let dry
5. **Prepare pen:** Remove cap; for dial pens, set dose (Wegovy pens are pre-set)
6. **Inject:**
   - Pinch skin fold (optional for most patients)
   - Insert needle at 90° angle
   - Press and hold button until click/counter shows 0
   - Hold for 5-10 seconds after injection
   - Remove needle and release skin
7. **Dispose:** Place pen/needle in sharps container

### Chunk 2 — Injection sites and rotation
**Approved sites:**
- Abdomen (most common, best absorption)
- Front of thigh
- Back of upper arm (may need assistance)

**Rotation:**
- Different spot each week
- At least 1 inch from previous site
- Prevents lipohypertrophy (fatty lumps)

### Chunk 3 — Storage and handling
**Before first use:**
- Refrigerate (36-46°F / 2-8°C)
- Do not freeze
- Protect from light (keep in box)

**After first use:**
- **Wegovy:** Can store at room temp (up to 86°F) for up to 28 days
- **Zepbound/Mounjaro:** Can store at room temp (up to 86°F) for up to 21 days
- Keep cap on when not in use

**Travel tips:**
- Use insulated bag with ice pack for transport
- TSA allows injectable medications with prescription
- Avoid leaving in hot car or checking in airplane cargo

### Chunk 4 — Troubleshooting common issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Needle anxiety | Use ice to numb site; demonstrate on practice pad first |
| Bruising | Normal; ensure proper technique, avoid blood vessels |
| Medication leaking | Hold needle in place for full 10 seconds after injection |
| Forgotten refrigeration | If <room temp limit and <time limit, still usable |
| Pen malfunction | Contact manufacturer; do not use if mechanism is damaged |

## Key visual(s) (figures, tables, diagrams)
- Diagram: Injection sites with rotation pattern
- Checklist: Injection technique steps (patient handout)
- Video: Pen demonstration

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- "The needle is tiny — most patients say it's easier than expected"
- First injection in office builds confidence
- Belly button = 2 inches is the "no-go zone"

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** How long should a patient hold the pen in place after pressing the button?
   - **Answer:** 5-10 seconds (until counter shows 0 or click is heard)
   - **Rationale:** Ensures full dose is delivered; prevents leakage
   - **Source:** Manufacturer instructions for use

2. **Question:** How long can Wegovy be stored at room temperature after first use?
   - **Answer:** Up to 28 days (at ≤86°F)
   - **Rationale:** Allows for travel and convenience without refrigeration
   - **Source:** Wegovy prescribing information
