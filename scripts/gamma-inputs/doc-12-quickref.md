# Nausea & Vomiting Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Incidence:** Nausea 30-44%, vomiting 12-24%
- **Onset:** Typically within 1-2 weeks of starting or increasing dose
- **Course:** Usually improves at stable maintenance dose
- **Mechanism:** Delayed gastric emptying + CNS effects

---

## Step 1: Lifestyle & Dietary Modifications (Mild Symptoms)

### Dietary Changes
- ✅ Eat smaller, more frequent meals (5-6 small vs 3 large)
- ✅ Avoid high-fat, greasy, or fried foods
- ✅ Eat slowly, chew thoroughly
- ✅ Stay upright 30-60 min after eating
- ✅ Stay hydrated (small sips throughout day)

### Foods to Try
- Bland: crackers, toast, rice, bananas, applesauce
- Ginger: tea, candies, chews (modest evidence)
- Cold foods (less aroma)

### Avoid
- Large portions
- Strong smells
- Spicy foods
- Carbonated beverages (may help some, worsen others)

**If symptoms persist >1-2 weeks despite measures → Step 2**

---

## Step 2: Add Antiemetic PRN (Moderate Symptoms)

### First-Line: Ondansetron (Zofran)
- **Dose:** 4-8 mg PO or ODT q8h PRN
- **Notes:** 5-HT3 antagonist; well-tolerated
- **Caution:** May cause constipation

### Alternatives
| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Promethazine (Phenergan) | 12.5-25 mg PO/PR q6h PRN | Sedating; good for severe nausea |
| Metoclopramide (Reglan) | 5-10 mg PO before meals | Prokinetic; short-term only (TD risk) |
| Meclizine | 25 mg PO q6h PRN | If vestibular component |
| Prochlorperazine (Compazine) | 5-10 mg PO q6h PRN | Alternative to promethazine |

### OTC Options
- Emetrol (phosphorated carbohydrate)
- Dramamine (dimenhydrinate)
- B6 (pyridoxine) 25 mg TID

**If symptoms persist despite antiemetics → Step 3**

---

## Step 3: Adjust Titration (Persistent Symptoms)

### Options
1. **Extend time at current dose**
   - Standard: 4 weeks per dose
   - Extended: 6-8 weeks if needed
   
2. **Use intermediate doses (tirzepatide)**
   - 7.5 mg and 12.5 mg are optional escalation steps
   
3. **Reduce dose temporarily**
   - Return to previous tolerated dose
   - Retry escalation after 2-4 weeks

4. **Consider not reaching max dose**
   - Lower doses still effective
   - Better to stay on therapy than quit

**If severe symptoms or unable to maintain intake → Step 4**

---

## Step 4: Hold Therapy & Evaluate (Severe Symptoms)

### Red Flags Requiring HOLD
- ⚠️ Persistent vomiting >24-48 hours
- ⚠️ Unable to keep fluids down
- ⚠️ Signs of dehydration (dark urine, dizziness, tachycardia)
- ⚠️ Severe abdominal pain → **rule out pancreatitis**

### Actions
1. **Hold GLP-1 RA**
2. **Assess hydration status**
   - If dehydrated: IV fluids, consider ER referral
3. **Evaluate for other causes**
   - Lipase if abdominal pain (pancreatitis)
   - Consider other GI pathology
4. **Restart when symptoms resolve**
   - Resume at lower dose and slower titration

---

## When to Discontinue

### Consider Stopping If:
- Symptoms persist despite dose reduction
- Unable to maintain adequate nutrition/hydration
- Patient wishes to discontinue
- Pancreatitis confirmed (do not re-challenge)

### Alternative Options After Discontinuation
- Trial different agent (semaglutide ↔ tirzepatide)
- Try other AOM class (phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion)
- Intensify lifestyle intervention
- Consider bariatric surgery referral

---

## Patient Counseling Script

> "Nausea is common when starting or increasing your dose, but it usually gets better over time. Here's what you can do:
> - Eat smaller meals throughout the day
> - Avoid greasy and fatty foods
> - Stay hydrated with small sips of water
> - I'm giving you a prescription for anti-nausea medication if you need it
> 
> Call us if you can't keep fluids down for more than a day, or if you have severe stomach pain."

---

## Quick Reference Summary

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Mild | Dietary modifications |
| Moderate | Add ondansetron PRN |
| Persistent | Extend dose interval or reduce dose |
| Severe | Hold, hydrate, evaluate; restart lower |

# Constipation Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Incidence:** 17-24%
- **Mechanism:** Slowed GI transit + reduced food/fluid intake
- **Compounding factor:** Ondansetron (for nausea) worsens constipation
- **Course:** May persist; often requires ongoing management

---

## Step 1: Lifestyle & Dietary Interventions (First-Line)

### Hydration
- ✅ Minimum 64 oz (8 cups) water daily
- ✅ More if experiencing vomiting/diarrhea
- ✅ Count other fluids (coffee, tea) but prioritize water

### Fiber
- ✅ Gradual increase to 25-30g/day
- ✅ Sources: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes
- ✅ Psyllium husk (Metamucil) 1 tsp daily → increase gradually
- ⚠️ Increase slowly to avoid bloating

### Activity
- ✅ Regular walking (promotes motility)
- ✅ Any movement helps

### Routine
- ✅ Establish consistent bowel routine
- ✅ Respond promptly to urge
- ✅ Consider post-meal timing (gastrocolic reflex)

**If no BM in 3+ days or symptoms bothersome → Step 2**

---

## Step 2: Add Osmotic Laxative (Moderate Symptoms)

### First-Line: Polyethylene Glycol (MiraLAX)
- **Dose:** 17g (1 capful) in 8 oz liquid daily
- **Onset:** 1-3 days
- **Notes:** Safe for daily use; well-tolerated
- **Can adjust:** Increase to BID if needed, or decrease to every other day

### Alternatives
| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Lactulose | 15-30 mL daily | Osmotic; may cause bloating |
| Magnesium citrate | 150-300 mL once | For acute relief (not daily use) |
| Milk of magnesia | 30-60 mL daily | Magnesium-based osmotic |

**If osmotic laxative insufficient after 3-5 days → Step 3**

---

## Step 3: Add Stimulant Laxative (Persistent Symptoms)

### Options (use PRN, not daily long-term)
| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Senna (Senokot) | 8.6-17.2 mg at bedtime | Stimulant; works overnight |
| Bisacodyl (Dulcolax) | 5-10 mg at bedtime | Tablet or suppository |

### Combination Approach
- Continue MiraLAX daily (maintenance)
- Add senna/bisacodyl PRN (rescue)

### Stool Softeners
- Docusate (Colace) 100-200 mg BID
- Modest benefit; can add to regimen
- Works best with adequate hydration

**If still refractory → Step 4**

---

## Step 4: Evaluate & Escalate (Refractory)

### Rule Out Obstruction
If severe, consider:
- Abdominal exam (distension, bowel sounds)
- Abdominal X-ray (if concern for impaction/obstruction)

### Prescription Options
| Medication | Class | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Lubiprostone (Amitiza) | Chloride channel activator | 8-24 mcg BID |
| Linaclotide (Linzess) | Guanylate cyclase-C agonist | 145-290 mcg daily |
| Prucalopride (Motegrity) | 5-HT4 agonist | 2 mg daily |

### Consider Dose Adjustment
- If constipation severe and quality-of-life impacting
- May need to reduce GLP-1 RA dose
- Balance weight loss efficacy vs tolerability

---

## Special Considerations

### Patient on Ondansetron for Nausea
- Ondansetron causes constipation (5-HT3 antagonist)
- Proactively start MiraLAX if using ondansetron
- Consider promethazine instead (less constipating)

### Opioid Users
- Compound constipation risk
- More aggressive bowel regimen needed
- Consider methylnaltrexone if opioid-induced

---

## Patient Counseling Script

> "Constipation is common with this medication because it slows down your digestive system. Here's what helps:
> - Drink plenty of water — at least 8 glasses a day
> - Eat fiber-rich foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
> - Stay active — even walking helps
> - If you need extra help, MiraLAX is safe to take daily
> 
> Let us know if you go more than 4-5 days without a bowel movement or have severe discomfort."

---

## Quick Reference Summary

| Severity | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Prevention | Hydration + fiber + activity |
| Mild | Add MiraLAX daily |
| Moderate | MiraLAX + senna/bisacodyl PRN |
| Severe/Refractory | Rx options, evaluate for obstruction |

# Diarrhea Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Incidence:** 20-30%
- **Course:** Usually mild-moderate; often self-limiting within 2-4 weeks
- **Mechanism:** Variable GI motility effects; some patients have accelerated transit
- **Risk:** Dehydration, especially in elderly or CKD patients

---

## Step 1: Supportive Care (Mild Symptoms)

### Hydration (Critical)
- ✅ Increase fluid intake significantly
- ✅ Oral rehydration solutions (Pedialyte, Gatorade, clear broths)
- ✅ Monitor for dehydration signs (dark urine, dizziness, dry mouth)

### Dietary Modifications
- ✅ BRAT diet temporarily: Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast
- ✅ Avoid high-fat, greasy foods
- ✅ Limit artificial sweeteners (sorbitol, mannitol — osmotic effect)
- ✅ Avoid caffeine and alcohol
- ✅ Reduce fiber temporarily (opposite of constipation advice)

### Reassurance
- "Diarrhea often improves within 2-4 weeks as your body adjusts"

**If symptoms persist >1 week or affecting quality of life → Step 2**

---

## Step 2: Add Antidiarrheal (Moderate Symptoms)

### First-Line: Loperamide (Imodium)
- **Dose:** 2 mg after first loose stool, then 2 mg after each subsequent loose stool
- **Maximum:** 8 mg/day (OTC limit); 16 mg/day (prescription)
- **Notes:** Use PRN, not prophylactically

### Alternative: Bismuth Subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)
- **Dose:** 524 mg q30-60min PRN, max 8 doses/day
- **Notes:** May turn stool black; avoid with aspirin allergy

### When NOT to Use Antidiarrheals
- ⚠️ Bloody stool
- ⚠️ High fever
- ⚠️ Severe abdominal pain
- → These require evaluation, not suppression

**If symptoms persist or severe → Step 3**

---

## Step 3: Dose Adjustment (Persistent Symptoms)

### Options
1. **Extend time at current dose**
   - Allow more time for adaptation
   
2. **Reduce dose temporarily**
   - Return to previous tolerated dose
   - Slower re-escalation

3. **Switch agents**
   - Some patients tolerate semaglutide vs tirzepatide differently
   - Individual variation is significant

**If severe symptoms → Step 4**

---

## Step 4: Evaluate for Other Causes (Severe/Atypical)

### Red Flags Requiring Workup
- ⚠️ Bloody or black stool
- ⚠️ Fever >101°F
- ⚠️ Severe abdominal pain
- ⚠️ Diarrhea >7-10 days unresponsive to treatment
- ⚠️ Signs of dehydration despite oral intake

### Differential Diagnosis
| Consideration | Evaluation |
|---------------|------------|
| Infectious diarrhea | Stool culture, C. diff testing |
| Malabsorption | Consider celiac, pancreatic insufficiency |
| IBD flare | If history of Crohn's/UC |
| Medication-induced | Review other meds (metformin, antibiotics) |
| Overflow diarrhea | Consider if alternating with constipation |

### Management of Severe Dehydration
- Consider IV fluids
- Hold GLP-1 RA until resolved
- Renal function check (AKI risk)

---

## Dehydration Assessment

### Signs of Mild Dehydration
- Thirst
- Slightly decreased urine output
- Mild fatigue

### Signs of Moderate-Severe Dehydration
- Dark urine or minimal output
- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Tachycardia
- Dry mucous membranes
- Confusion (severe)

### Action
- Mild: Oral rehydration at home
- Moderate-Severe: Consider ER/urgent care for IV fluids

---

## Patient Counseling Script

> "Loose stools can happen with this medication, especially early on. Here's what to do:
> - Drink extra fluids — water, Gatorade, or clear broths
> - Eat bland foods like bananas, rice, toast
> - Avoid greasy foods and artificial sweeteners
> - If it's bothersome, take Imodium (2 mg) after each loose stool, up to 4 doses/day
> 
> Call us right away if you see blood in your stool, have a fever, or feel dizzy and can't keep fluids down."

---

## Quick Reference Summary

| Severity | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Mild | Hydration + dietary modification |
| Moderate | Add loperamide PRN |
| Persistent | Dose adjustment, allow adaptation time |
| Severe/Atypical | Hold therapy, evaluate, hydrate |

# Gallbladder Symptoms Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Incidence:** 2-3x increased risk of cholelithiasis/cholecystitis
- **Mechanism:** Rapid weight loss → bile supersaturation → gallstone formation
- **Not unique to GLP-1 RAs:** Occurs with any rapid weight loss (diet, surgery)
- **Risk period:** Highest during active weight loss phase

---

## Risk Factors for Gallbladder Events
- Rapid weight loss (>1.5 lbs/week)
- Female sex
- Age >40
- Prior gallbladder symptoms
- Family history of gallstones
- Obesity itself (higher baseline risk)

---

## Symptom Recognition

### Biliary Colic (Symptomatic Gallstones)
- RUQ pain, often postprandial (especially after fatty meals)
- Pain may radiate to right shoulder/back
- Nausea, bloating
- Episodes lasting 30 min to several hours
- Resolves spontaneously

### Acute Cholecystitis (Gallbladder Inflammation)
- Persistent RUQ pain (>6 hours)
- Fever
- Murphy's sign (pain with deep palpation during inspiration)
- Nausea, vomiting
- May have elevated WBC, abnormal LFTs

---

## Step 1: Evaluate Suspected Gallbladder Symptoms

### Initial Assessment
1. **History:** Character, location, duration, triggers (fatty food)
2. **Exam:** RUQ tenderness, Murphy's sign, fever
3. **Labs:** CBC, CMP (LFTs), lipase (rule out pancreatitis)

### Imaging
- **First-line:** RUQ Ultrasound
  - Gallstones
  - Gallbladder wall thickening (>4 mm)
  - Pericholecystic fluid
  - Sonographic Murphy's sign

---

## Step 2: Management Based on Findings

### Asymptomatic Gallstones (Incidental Finding)
- **Action:** No immediate intervention needed
- Continue GLP-1 RA
- Counsel patient on symptoms to watch for
- Low-fat diet may reduce symptom risk
- No prophylactic cholecystectomy

### Biliary Colic (Symptomatic Gallstones, No Cholecystitis)
- **Acute:** NSAIDs or antispasmodics for pain
- **Referral:** General surgery for elective cholecystectomy
- **GLP-1 RA:** Can often continue while awaiting surgery
- **Diet:** Low-fat diet to reduce episodes

### Acute Cholecystitis
- **Immediate:** Hold GLP-1 RA
- **Referral:** ER/hospital admission
- **Treatment:** IV antibiotics, surgery evaluation
- **Timing:** Cholecystectomy (within 24-72 hours preferred if uncomplicated)

---

## Step 3: Post-Cholecystectomy Management

### After Gallbladder Removal
- ✅ Can safely resume GLP-1 RA therapy
- ✅ Gallbladder risk eliminated
- ⚠️ Some patients have post-cholecystectomy diarrhea (bile salt malabsorption)
  - Usually improves over time
  - Cholestyramine if persistent

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Counsel at Initiation
- "Rapid weight loss can increase gallstone risk — this happens with any method of weight loss"
- "Symptoms to watch for: pain in your upper right abdomen, especially after eating fatty foods"

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Moderate (not extreme) caloric restriction
- Avoid prolonged fasting
- Include some healthy fats (paradoxically, very low-fat diets may increase risk)
- Adequate hydration

### No Proven Pharmacologic Prevention
- Ursodiol sometimes used post-bariatric surgery
- Not routinely recommended for GLP-1 therapy

## Patient Counseling Script

> "When you lose weight quickly, your body can form gallstones. This can happen with any weight loss method, not just medication.
> 
> Watch for: pain in your upper right belly, especially after eating fatty or greasy foods. It might also go to your shoulder or back.
> 
> If this happens, let us know. If the pain is severe, you have a fever, or it doesn't go away, go to the ER.
> 
> If you do need your gallbladder removed, you can continue the medication afterward."

# Pancreatitis Recognition & Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Incidence:** ~0.2-0.3% (rare but serious)
- **FDA Warning:** Listed in warnings/precautions for all GLP-1 RAs
- **Key Point:** If pancreatitis occurs, **do NOT re-challenge** with any GLP-1 RA

---

## ⚠️ Critical: When to Suspect Pancreatitis

### Classic Presentation
- **Severe epigastric/periumbilical pain**
- Often radiates to the back
- Worse after eating
- Patient may prefer sitting/leaning forward
- Associated nausea, vomiting
- May have fever, tachycardia if severe

### Pain Characteristics
| Feature | Pancreatitis | Typical GLP-1 GI AEs |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Location | Epigastric, radiates to back | Diffuse, crampy |
| Severity | Severe (7-10/10) | Mild-moderate |
| Duration | Persistent (hours) | Intermittent |
| Association | Worse with eating | Variable |

---

## Step 1: Immediate Actions

### If Pancreatitis Suspected:
1. **STOP GLP-1 RA immediately** — do not give next dose
2. **Obtain stat labs:**
   - Lipase (>3× ULN confirms diagnosis)
   - CBC, BMP, LFTs
   - Triglycerides (if >1000, consider hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis)
3. **Clinical assessment:**
   - Vital signs (fever, tachycardia, hypotension)
   - Abdominal exam (tenderness, guarding)
   - Hydration status

### Lipase Interpretation
| Lipase Level | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Normal (<60 U/L typical) | Pancreatitis unlikely |
| 1-3× ULN | Possible, but nonspecific |
| >3× ULN | Confirms acute pancreatitis |

**Note:** Mild lipase elevation can occur with GLP-1 RAs without clinical pancreatitis

---

## Step 2: Confirmed Pancreatitis Management

### Severity Assessment (Atlanta Classification)
- **Mild:** No organ failure, no local complications
- **Moderate:** Transient organ failure (<48h) or local complications
- **Severe:** Persistent organ failure (>48h)

### Treatment Principles
1. **NPO** — bowel rest
2. **IV fluids** — aggressive hydration (lactated Ringer's preferred)
3. **Pain control** — IV opioids often needed
4. **Monitor** — vital signs, urine output, labs q6-12h initially
5. **Hospitalize** — all but mildest cases

### When to Hospitalize
- All confirmed acute pancreatitis should be evaluated for admission
- Mild cases: may be managed in observation
- Moderate-severe: ICU consideration

---

## Step 3: Etiology Workup

### Common Causes (Even if on GLP-1 RA)
| Cause | Evaluation |
|-------|------------|
| Gallstones | RUQ ultrasound |
| Alcohol | History |
| Hypertriglyceridemia | Triglyceride level |
| Medications | Review all meds |
| GLP-1 RA | May be contributing but don't assume |

**Important:** GLP-1 RA may be contributory, but evaluate for other treatable causes

---

## Step 4: Post-Recovery Management

### After Pancreatitis Resolution
1. **Do NOT re-challenge with any GLP-1 RA**
   - This is a contraindication going forward
   - Applies to all GLP-1 RAs (semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, etc.)

2. **Document clearly in chart:**
   - "History of acute pancreatitis while on [medication name]"
   - "GLP-1 receptor agonists contraindicated"
   - Add to allergy/adverse reaction list

3. **Alternative weight management:**
   - Other AOM classes (phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, orlistat)
   - Bariatric surgery referral if appropriate
   - Intensive lifestyle intervention

---

## Differentiating Pancreatitis from Routine GI Symptoms

| Feature | Routine GI AEs | Pancreatitis |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Pain severity | Mild-moderate | Severe |
| Pain location | Diffuse abdominal | Epigastric, to back |
| Duration | Intermittent | Persistent hours |
| Fever | No | Possible |
| Lipase | Normal or mildly elevated | >3× ULN |
| Response to dose hold | Improves | Requires treatment |

---

## Patient Counseling (At Initiation)

> "There's a small risk of pancreatitis — inflammation of the pancreas — with this medication. It's rare (less than 1 in 200 patients), but serious.
> 
> If you develop severe stomach pain — especially in the upper middle area that goes through to your back and doesn't go away — stop the medication and seek medical attention right away.
> 
> Don't confuse this with the mild nausea or stomach discomfort that's common with the medication. We're talking about severe pain."

---

## Quick Reference Summary

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Severe epigastric pain + high lipase | STOP GLP-1; hospitalize |
| Mild lipase elevation, no symptoms | Continue monitoring |
| Post-pancreatitis | NEVER re-challenge |
| After recovery | Alternative AOMs only |

# Hypoglycemia Prevention & Management Algorithm

## Clinical Context
- **Risk with GLP-1 RA monotherapy:** LOW (glucose-dependent mechanism)
- **Risk with concurrent insulin or sulfonylurea:** SIGNIFICANT
- **Key:** Proactive medication adjustment prevents most episodes

---

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Patients
| Risk Factor | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| On insulin (basal or bolus) | Additive glucose-lowering |
| On sulfonylurea (glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride) | Non-glucose-dependent insulin secretion |
| History of hypoglycemia | Hypoglycemia unawareness |
| Elderly | Impaired counter-regulation |
| Renal impairment | Reduced drug clearance |
| Irregular eating patterns | Mismatch between meds and food |

### Low-Risk Patients
- GLP-1 RA + metformin only
- GLP-1 RA + SGLT2 inhibitor only
- GLP-1 RA monotherapy

---

## Prevention: Medication Adjustment at Initiation

### When Starting GLP-1 RA in Diabetic Patient

| Concurrent Med | Adjustment |
|----------------|------------|
| **Basal insulin** | Reduce by 20-25% |
| **Bolus/prandial insulin** | Reduce by 25-50% (larger reduction due to appetite suppression) |
| **Sulfonylurea** | Reduce by 50% OR discontinue |
| **Metformin** | Continue unchanged |
| **SGLT2 inhibitor** | Continue unchanged |
| **DPP-4 inhibitor** | DISCONTINUE (overlapping mechanism) |

### Titration Phase
- Monitor glucose closely during dose escalation
- Patient may need further reductions as appetite decreases
- "Check your blood sugar more often for the first few weeks"

---

## Hypoglycemia Recognition

### Symptoms
**Adrenergic (early):**
- Tremor, shakiness
- Sweating
- Palpitations
- Anxiety
- Hunger

**Neuroglycopenic (late/severe):**
- Confusion
- Difficulty speaking
- Blurred vision
- Weakness
- Seizure, loss of consciousness (severe)

### Hypoglycemia Unawareness
- Some patients (especially long-duration diabetes) lose warning symptoms
- May present with neuroglycopenic symptoms first
- Higher risk population — educate caregivers

---

## Hypoglycemia Treatment

### Conscious Patient (Mild-Moderate)

#### "Rule of 15"
1. **Consume 15g fast-acting carbohydrate:**
   - 4 glucose tablets
   - 4 oz (½ cup) juice or regular soda
   - 1 tablespoon honey or sugar
   - Glucose gel

2. **Wait 15 minutes**

3. **Recheck blood glucose**
   - If still <70 mg/dL → repeat 15g carbs
   - If >70 mg/dL → eat a snack with protein

### Unconscious or Unable to Swallow (Severe)

**Do NOT give oral carbs** (aspiration risk)

**Options:**
- **Glucagon injection:** 1 mg IM/SC (traditional)
- **Glucagon nasal spray (Baqsimi):** 3 mg intranasal
- **Call 911** if glucagon unavailable

**After recovery:**
- Check glucose
- Give oral carbs once able to swallow
- Identify cause and adjust medications

---

## Post-Hypoglycemia Management

### Adjust Medications
1. **Identify the cause:**
   - Missed meal?
   - Excessive insulin dose?
   - Increased activity?
   - GLP-1 RA effect on appetite?

2. **Reduce offending agent:**
   - Further insulin reduction
   - Discontinue sulfonylurea if recurrent

3. **Document the episode:**
   - Glucose level
   - Symptoms
   - Treatment
   - Medication adjustments made

### Follow-Up
- Closer monitoring
- Consider CGM if recurrent hypoglycemia
- Reassess at next visit

---

## Patient Education Checklist

### At Initiation (High-Risk Patients)
- [ ] Explain hypoglycemia symptoms
- [ ] Teach "Rule of 15"
- [ ] Provide glucose tablets or equivalent
- [ ] Prescribe glucagon (for severe events)
- [ ] Educate family/caregivers
- [ ] Set glucose checking frequency
- [ ] Explain when to call

### Written Instructions

> "Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can happen if you're taking insulin or certain diabetes pills along with your GLP-1 medication.
> 
> **Signs of low blood sugar:**
> - Shaking, sweating, fast heartbeat
> - Feeling hungry, anxious, confused
> 
> **If this happens:**
> 1. Eat or drink 15 grams of sugar (4 glucose tablets, ½ cup juice)
> 2. Wait 15 minutes
> 3. Check your blood sugar — if still low, repeat
> 
> **Call 911 if you pass out or can't swallow.**
> 
> Always carry glucose tablets with you."

---

## Quick Reference Summary

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Starting GLP-1 + insulin | Reduce insulin 20-25% |
| Starting GLP-1 + SU | Reduce SU 50% or stop |
| Mild hypoglycemia | Rule of 15 |
| Severe hypoglycemia | Glucagon + 911 |
| Recurrent hypoglycemia | Further med reduction, consider CGM |

# Missed Dose Rules — Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide (Label Summary)

## Purpose
A single quick-reference note for **label-based** missed dose instructions.

## Semaglutide (Wegovy / Ozempic)
### Wegovy (semaglutide) — missed dose (PI section 2.4)
- If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is **more than 2 days away (48 hours)**, administer WEGOVY as soon as possible.
- If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is **less than 2 days away (48 hours)**, do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
- If **2 or more consecutive doses are missed**, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule (may reduce GI symptoms with reinitiation).

### Ozempic (semaglutide) — missed dose
- If you miss a dose of OZEMPIC, take the missed dose as soon as possible **within 5 days** after the missed dose.
- If **more than 5 days** have passed, skip the missed dose and take your next dose on the regularly scheduled day.

## Tirzepatide (Zepbound / Mounjaro)
### Zepbound (tirzepatide) — missed dose
- If you miss a dose of ZEPBOUND, take the missed dose as soon as possible **within 4 days (96 hours)** after the missed dose.
- If **more than 4 days** have passed, skip the missed dose and take your next dose on the regularly scheduled day.
- Do not take 2 doses of ZEPBOUND **within 3 days (72 hours)** of each other.

### Mounjaro (tirzepatide) — missed dose
- If you miss a dose of MOUNJARO, take the missed dose as soon as possible **within 4 days (96 hours)** after the missed dose.
- If **more than 4 days** have passed, skip the missed dose and take your next dose on the regularly scheduled day.
- Do not take 2 doses of MOUNJARO **within 3 days (72 hours)** of each other.

## Teaching note
- When in doubt, default to the specific product’s PI and document the rationale.

# Drug Interactions — GLP-1 AOMs (label-derived)

## Overview

GLP-1 receptor agonists delay gastric emptying, which may impact the absorption of concomitant oral medications. Clinical significance varies.

---

## Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic) Drug Interactions

### Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues
- **Clinical significance:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia
- **Recommendation:** Consider reducing the dose of concomitant insulin or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylureas) when initiating or escalating semaglutide
- **Monitoring:** Increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring during initiation/escalation

### Oral Medications (General)
- Semaglutide delays gastric emptying, which may impact absorption of oral medications
- In clinical pharmacology studies:
  - No clinically relevant effect on absorption of metformin, digoxin, warfarin, combined oral contraceptives (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel), or atorvastatin
  - The delay in absorption varied by medication and was generally small

### Warfarin
- No clinically relevant interaction observed in dedicated study
- **Recommendation:** May consider more frequent INR monitoring when initiating or changing semaglutide dose in patients on warfarin

### Oral Contraceptives
- No clinically relevant interaction observed with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel
- No dose adjustment required

Source: Wegovy PI Section 7; Ozempic PI Section 7

---

## Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro) Drug Interactions

### Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues
- **Clinical significance:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia
- **Recommendation:** Consider reducing the dose of concomitant insulin or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylureas) when initiating tirzepatide
- **Monitoring:** Increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring during initiation/escalation

### Oral Medications (General)
- Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying, which may impact absorption of oral medications
- The effect on gastric emptying is maximal after the first dose and diminishes over time

### Oral Contraceptives
- **Clinical significance:** Potential for reduced efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives
- **Recommendation:** Patients using oral hormonal contraceptives should switch to a non-oral contraceptive method OR add a barrier method for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation
- **Rationale:** Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate decreased by 55–66% and 21–44%, respectively, when given with tirzepatide

### Other Oral Medications Studied
- Metformin: Cmax decreased 50% and AUC decreased 18%; no dose adjustment recommended due to time-averaging effect
- Warfarin: Consider more frequent INR monitoring; no significant interaction in study but gastric emptying delay may affect absorption timing
- Digoxin: No clinically meaningful effect
- Sitagliptin, lisinopril: No clinically meaningful effect

## Clinical Pearls

### Medications Requiring Close Monitoring
| Drug Class | Concern | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Insulin | Hypoglycemia | Reduce dose at GLP-1 initiation |
| Sulfonylureas | Hypoglycemia | Consider dose reduction |
| Warfarin | INR changes | More frequent monitoring |
| Oral contraceptives (tirzepatide only) | Reduced efficacy | Barrier method or non-oral contraceptive |

### Medications with Narrow Therapeutic Index
- For medications with narrow therapeutic indices (warfarin, digoxin, phenytoin, lithium), monitor closely when initiating GLP-1 therapy
- Gastric emptying delay is greatest at initiation and with dose escalation
- Effect diminishes somewhat over time

### Timing Considerations
- No specific timing requirements stated in labels
- General principle: medications requiring consistent absorption may warrant monitoring during GLP-1 titration

---

## Key Difference: Semaglutide vs Tirzepatide

**Oral contraceptives:**
- Semaglutide: No clinically relevant interaction; no additional precautions needed
- Tirzepatide: Recommend barrier method or non-oral contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and each dose escalation

This is a practical counseling difference when prescribing to patients on hormonal contraceptives.

# Special Populations — GLP-1 AOMs (label-derived)

## Pregnancy

### Semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic)
- **Pregnancy Category:** Not assigned (post-PLLR)
- **Recommendation:** Discontinue semaglutide at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to long washout period
- **Risk Summary:** Based on animal reproduction studies, may cause fetal harm. Embryo-fetal toxicity observed in animals at clinically relevant exposures.
- **Human Data:** Limited data in pregnant women; insufficient to evaluate drug-associated risk
- **Counsel:** Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to fetus

### Tirzepatide (Zepbound/Mounjaro)
- **Pregnancy Category:** Not assigned (post-PLLR)
- **Recommendation:** Discontinue tirzepatide at least 1 month before a planned pregnancy
- **Risk Summary:** Based on animal reproduction studies, may cause fetal harm. Adverse developmental effects observed in animals at clinically relevant exposures.
- **Human Data:** Limited data in pregnant women
- **Counsel:** Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to fetus

### Clinical Note
- Weight loss during pregnancy offers no benefit and may cause fetal harm
- For patients planning pregnancy: discontinue semaglutide ≥2 months prior; discontinue tirzepatide ≥1 month prior

## Lactation

### Semaglutide
- **Recommendation:** No data on presence in human milk, effects on breastfed infant, or effects on milk production
- **Animal data:** Present in milk of lactating rats
- Consider developmental/health benefits of breastfeeding, mother's clinical need, and potential adverse effects on breastfed child

### Tirzepatide
- **Recommendation:** No data on presence in human milk
- **Animal data:** Present in milk of lactating rats
- Consider developmental/health benefits of breastfeeding, mother's clinical need, and potential adverse effects on breastfed child

## Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

### Contraception
**Semaglutide:**
- Recommend contraception during treatment
- Discontinue ≥2 months before planned pregnancy (due to long half-life ~1 week)

**Tirzepatide:**
- Recommend contraception during treatment
- Discontinue ≥1 month before planned pregnancy
- **Important:** Oral hormonal contraceptives may have reduced efficacy; recommend barrier method or non-oral contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and each dose escalation

### Fertility
- Animal studies: No effects on male fertility (semaglutide, tirzepatide)
- Menstrual irregularities and effects on female fertility observed in animal studies; relevance to humans unknown

# Protocol - GLP‑1 Initiation & Titration (generic)

## When to use
- Starting a GLP‑1 RA / dual agonist for chronic weight management (adapt per specific product label).

## Goals / outcomes
- Maximize fat loss while preserving lean mass
- Minimize GI adverse effects
- Maintain adherence and safety

## Step-by-step protocol (high level)
1) Confirm indication + screen contraindications/precautions.
2) Baseline: weight, waist (optional), BP, HR; consider A1c if indicated; pregnancy status when relevant.
3) Start at label starting dose.
4) Titrate per label interval *if tolerated*; delay escalation if clinically significant GI symptoms.
5) Provide nutrition + hydration + constipation prevention plan from day 1.
6) Follow-up schedule (example): 2–4 weeks early check; then q4–12 weeks depending on stability.

## Dosing / titration details
- Keep product-specific details in each medication note and link them here.

## Monitoring plan
- Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, constipation, reflux
- Hydration status
- Gallbladder symptoms; pancreatitis symptoms (rare but serious)

## Patient counseling (plain language)
- "We start low and go slow so your body adjusts. If you feel too nauseated, we hold the dose longer rather than pushing up." 

## Red flags / when to stop or refer
- Persistent vomiting/dehydration
- Severe abdominal pain (concern for pancreatitis/gallbladder)
- Pregnancy

## Documentation checklist
- Indication and baseline metrics
- Contraindication screening
- Counseling on risks/benefits + expectations
- Follow-up plan

## Source links
- Add product labels + guideline sources as you collect them.
