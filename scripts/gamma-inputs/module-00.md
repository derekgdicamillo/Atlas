# Lesson 0.1 — Why I Built This Course

## Learner level
- Any prescribing provider considering or already using GLP-1 medications
- No prior obesity medicine training assumed

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture (personal narrative + clinical context)

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Describe the instructor's path from personal obesity to weight loss practice
2. Identify the common failure pattern in GLP-1 prescribing (prescribe and pray)
3. Explain why a structured framework matters more than the medication itself

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "You've written the prescription. Your patient is losing weight. Three months later, the nausea is unbearable, they haven't changed their diet, and they want to quit. Sound familiar?"

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — The backstory

I was obese myself. Not theoretically, not a few pounds over. Clinically obese. And I did what most people do: tried diets, tried exercise programs, lost weight, gained it back, lost it again, gained back more. The full cycle.

When I started my NP training, I realized something that changed everything for me. This wasn't a discipline problem. This was a biology problem. My body was fighting me at every step, resetting my hunger signals, dropping my metabolism, making regain almost inevitable.

That realization is what got me into weight loss medicine. First to help myself. Then I realized I could help other people too.

### Chunk 2 — What I saw when I started prescribing

I started prescribing GLP-1 medications and the results were incredible at first. Patients losing 15, 20, 30 percent of their body weight. But then I started seeing patterns that concerned me.

Some patients were losing weight but losing muscle along with it. Others were so nauseated they could barely eat, and when they did eat, they were making poor choices because nobody told them what to prioritize. Others hit their goal weight, stopped the medication, and gained it all back within a year.

The medication was working. The outcomes were still failing. And I realized the problem wasn't the drug. The problem was that nobody was building anything around the drug.

### Chunk 3 — The gap in current education

I looked at every course, every CME program, every certification available for GLP-1 prescribing. They all teach the same thing: pharmacology, dosing protocols, side effect management, and that's it.

Nobody was teaching providers how to actually run a weight loss practice that gets patients to long-term success. Nobody was talking about the nutrition piece, the movement programming, the mental health component, the ongoing support structures that determine whether a patient keeps the weight off or regains it all.

The clinical knowledge exists. It's scattered across guidelines and journal articles and conference talks. But the operational framework, the system that ties it all together and makes it work in a real practice with real patients, that didn't exist.

So I built it.

### Chunk 4 — What this course is (and isn't)

This course is not another pharmacology review. You'll get the pharmacology, and it'll be thorough. But that's the floor, not the ceiling.

This course teaches you how to build a weight loss practice that actually works. One where patients don't just lose weight, they keep it off. One where you're not just writing prescriptions, you're running a system that addresses the five domains that determine long-term success.

By the end of this course, you'll have the clinical knowledge to prescribe safely, the operational framework to run your practice efficiently, and a patient system that keeps people engaged and succeeding long after the initial weight loss phase.

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Weight loss without muscle preservation leads to metabolic decline and inevitable regain
- The #1 predictor of long-term weight maintenance isn't the medication. It's the support structure around it.
- Providers who build systems around the prescription have 3-4x the patient retention of those who don't

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** What is the most common failure pattern Derek identifies in current GLP-1 prescribing?
   - **Answer:** Prescribing the medication without building a support system around it (nutrition, movement, monitoring, mental health, ongoing engagement)
   - **Rationale:** The medication addresses appetite and weight loss biology, but long-term success requires addressing multiple domains simultaneously

2. **Question:** Why does weight loss without attention to body composition often lead to poor long-term outcomes?
   - **Answer:** Muscle loss during weight loss reduces metabolic rate, making weight regain more likely when the medication is reduced or stopped
   - **Rationale:** Preserving lean mass during GLP-1 therapy requires intentional protein intake and resistance training, not just caloric reduction

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- GLP-1 medications are a powerful tool, but the tool alone isn't enough for lasting results
- Current education teaches pharmacology but not practice systems, and that gap is where patients fail
- This course gives you both the clinical depth and the operational framework to build a practice that gets real, sustained outcomes

# Lesson 0.2 — The 5 Pillars of Functional Medical Weight Loss

## Learner level
- Any prescribing provider
- No prior obesity medicine training assumed

## Time + format
- Time: 15 min
- Format: Video lecture (framework reveal + clinical rationale)

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Name the 5 Pillars of Functional Medical Weight Loss
2. Explain the clinical rationale for each pillar

## Hook (clinical scenario / why this matters)
- "If I gave you the best GLP-1 protocol in the world and nothing else, what would your patient outcomes look like at 2 years? Be honest."

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Why a framework matters

Every successful medical specialty has a framework. Cardiology has risk stratification protocols. Oncology has staging systems. Diabetes management has the ADA Standards of Care.

Weight loss medicine doesn't have an equivalent. Most providers are prescribing GLP-1s based on the label, managing side effects as they come up, and hoping the patient figures out the rest on their own.

That approach produces short-term weight loss and long-term failure. Not because the provider is bad, but because the system around the patient is incomplete.

The 5 Pillars framework gives you a complete system. It's what we use at PV Medispa, and it's the operating system that turns GLP-1 prescribing into a full weight loss practice.

### Chunk 2 — The 5 Pillars

**Pillar 1: Precision Weight Science**
This is the clinical foundation. Medication selection, dosing, titration, monitoring, labs, body composition tracking. It's the pharmacotherapy piece that most courses cover well. But precision means more than writing the right dose. It means tracking body composition (not just scale weight), adjusting based on lean mass preservation, and knowing when to hold, titrate, or switch.

Addressed in: Modules 1-4, 6

**Pillar 2: Nourishing Health**
GLP-1 medications reduce appetite. That's the mechanism. But reduced appetite doesn't mean improved nutrition. Patients eating 1,000 calories of processed food are going to lose muscle, feel terrible, and regain everything.

This pillar focuses on protein-first nutrition (targeting goal body weight in grams of protein per day), fiber intake, hydration, and meal timing. The goal is to feed the body what it needs with the limited appetite patients have.

Clinical target: Protein at 1g per pound of goal body weight per day, minimum. This is non-negotiable for lean mass preservation.

Addressed in: Module 5 (prevention), Module 6 (monitoring), Module 10 (patient systems)

**Pillar 3: Dynamic Movement**
Weight loss without resistance training is a recipe for sarcopenic obesity. The research is clear on this. Patients need structured movement that preserves and builds lean mass, not just cardio for calorie burn.

This pillar covers resistance training fundamentals (providers need to understand enough to counsel patients), activity prescriptions, and how to adapt movement recommendations to different fitness levels and physical limitations.

Addressed in: Module 10 (patient systems), supplementary materials

**Pillar 4: Mindful Wellness**
The mental health component is where most programs fall short. Weight loss triggers identity shifts, relationship changes, body image issues, and emotional eating patterns that surface when appetite suppression removes the patient's primary coping mechanism.

This pillar covers screening for disordered eating, building psychological resilience, stress management, sleep optimization, and knowing when to refer to behavioral health.

Addressed in: Module 3 (patient selection, setting expectations), Module 8 (practice implementation)

**Pillar 5: Functional Wellness**
This is the integrative medicine lens. Inflammation management, gut health, hormonal optimization, and addressing the root causes that contributed to obesity in the first place. GLP-1s treat the symptom (excess weight). Functional wellness addresses why the patient got there.

This includes lab monitoring beyond standard metabolic panels, recognizing when thyroid, cortisol, or sex hormone issues are contributing factors, and using evidence-based supplementation where appropriate.

Addressed in: Module 6 (labs), Module 7 (special populations), Module 9 (emerging evidence)

### Chunk 3 — How the pillars work together

Each pillar addresses a common failure mode:

| Failure mode | Missing pillar |
|---|---|
| Patient loses weight but loses significant muscle mass | Nourishing Health + Dynamic Movement |
| Patient reaches goal weight, stops medication, regains everything | Precision Weight Science (no maintenance protocol) |
| Patient develops severe side effects and quits | Precision Weight Science (titration) + Nourishing Health |
| Patient loses weight but feels worse mentally | Mindful Wellness |
| Patient loses weight but inflammatory markers don't improve | Functional Wellness |
| Patient is compliant but plateaus early | All pillars need reassessment |

The pillars aren't sequential. They run in parallel from day one. Every patient visit should touch on at least 2-3 pillars, and your practice systems should have built-in checkpoints for all five.

### Chunk 4 — This is your differentiator

Here's the practical reality. Any provider can write a semaglutide prescription. The barrier to entry for GLP-1 prescribing is low. Which means competition is high and getting higher.

What sets a successful weight loss practice apart isn't the prescription. It's the system around it. Patients can get the medication anywhere. What they can't get anywhere is a structured, comprehensive approach that addresses nutrition, movement, mental health, and root causes alongside the pharmacotherapy.

The 5 Pillars framework is that system. It's what keeps patients in your practice instead of switching to the next Telehealth app. It's what produces outcomes you can actually be proud of. And it's what you'll learn to implement across the rest of this course.

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- Protein target: 1g per pound of goal body weight per day. This single intervention prevents more muscle loss than any other
- Patients who engage in resistance training during GLP-1 therapy preserve 2-3x more lean mass than those who don't
- Sleep deprivation (<6 hours) increases ghrelin and can blunt GLP-1 medication effectiveness. Always screen for sleep.
- The patient who "isn't losing weight" often has an inflammation or hormonal issue that needs investigation, not a higher dose

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Name the 5 Pillars of Functional Medical Weight Loss.
   - **Answer:** Precision Weight Science, Nourishing Health, Dynamic Movement, Mindful Wellness, Functional Wellness
   - **Rationale:** These five domains represent the complete system needed for sustainable weight management outcomes

2. **Question:** A patient on semaglutide 1.7 mg is losing weight but reports significant fatigue and hair thinning. Which pillar(s) most likely need attention?
   - **Answer:** Nourishing Health (likely inadequate protein/micronutrient intake due to reduced appetite) and Functional Wellness (check thyroid, iron, vitamin D, ferritin)
   - **Rationale:** Reduced appetite from GLP-1s frequently leads to inadequate nutrition. Fatigue and hair loss signal protein deficiency and/or micronutrient gaps that need investigation.

3. **Question:** Why is resistance training specifically recommended over general cardio for GLP-1 patients?
   - **Answer:** Weight loss from GLP-1s includes both fat and lean mass. Resistance training preferentially preserves lean mass, maintaining metabolic rate and functional strength. Cardio alone does not prevent sarcopenia during rapid weight loss.
   - **Rationale:** Up to 40% of weight lost can be lean mass without intervention. Resistance training reduces this to 15-20%.

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- The 5 Pillars framework turns GLP-1 prescribing from a single intervention into a complete practice system
- Each pillar addresses a specific, predictable failure mode in weight loss management
- Implementing all five pillars is what differentiates a weight loss practice from a prescription mill

# Lesson 0.3 — How This Course Works

## Learner level
- All enrolled providers

## Time + format
- Time: 10 min
- Format: Video lecture (course orientation)

## Learning objectives (measurable)
1. Choose the learning track that matches their experience level and time availability
2. Locate and use supplementary resources (quick reference guides, documentation templates, patient handouts)
3. Understand the assessment and completion requirements

## Hook
- "You're busy. I respect that. So let me show you exactly how to get the most out of this course in the time you have."

## Core content (chunked)

### Chunk 1 — Course structure overview

This course has 11 modules (including this one), 48 lessons, and roughly 12 hours of content.

Each lesson follows the same structure:
- **Hook**: A clinical scenario or question that frames why this topic matters
- **Core content**: Broken into 3-4 digestible chunks, with the clinical substance you need
- **Clinical pearls**: The high-yield takeaways you'll actually remember
- **Knowledge checks**: 2-3 questions with rationales, so you're testing yourself as you go
- **Take-home summary**: Three points you should walk away with

The consistency is intentional. Once you know the format, you can move through lessons faster because you know exactly where to find what you need.

### Chunk 2 — Learning tracks

Not everyone needs every module. Here are four paths depending on where you're starting from:

**Full Course** (~12 hours)
All 11 modules in order. This is the recommended track for anyone new to GLP-1 prescribing or building a weight loss practice from scratch.

**Essentials Track** (~6 hours)
Modules 0-5 + Module 8. Covers the prescribing fundamentals: patient selection, dosing, side effect management, and practice implementation. Good for providers who already have some GLP-1 experience and want to fill gaps.

**Quick Start** (~2.5 hours)
Modules 3-4 plus the adverse effect management algorithms. For experienced prescribers who just need the protocols and decision trees. Jump in, get what you need, get back to your patients.

**Practice Builder Track** (~10.5 hours)
Modules 0-8 + Module 10. Everything clinical plus the business blueprint. For providers who want to build or expand a dedicated weight loss practice.

My recommendation: start with the Full Course. Even experienced prescribers tell me they find gaps they didn't know they had. But the choice is yours.

### Chunk 3 — Supplementary resources

Beyond the video modules, you have access to:

**Provider Quick Reference Compendium**
Medication one-pagers, dosing ladders, adverse effect algorithms, drug interactions, storage and handling. Everything you need at the point of care, in one document.

**Clinical Documentation Toolkit**
Chart note templates for initial and follow-up visits, informed consent outline, prior authorization appeal letters, and letters of medical necessity. Copy these into your EHR and adapt them to your practice.

**Patient Education Resource Pack**
Injection technique guides, eating guides, side effect management handouts, and "What to Expect" documents. Hand these to your patients or share digitally.

**Prescriber Cheat Sheet**
A single-page rapid reference with eligibility criteria, dosing ladders, missed dose rules, red flags, and lab monitoring schedules. Print this and keep it at your desk.

These aren't filler. They're the operational tools that turn the knowledge from this course into daily clinical practice.

### Chunk 4 — Assessment and completion

Each module has a 10-question quiz at the end. Passing score is 70%. You can retake as many times as you need.

After completing all modules, there's a 50-question final examination. Passing score is 80%. Two retakes allowed.

There are also 3 integrated case studies that ask you to apply knowledge across multiple modules. These are written response format, and they're designed to test whether you can think through real clinical scenarios, not just recall facts.

Course completion certificate is issued when you've passed all module quizzes, the final exam, and submitted the case studies.

The goal isn't to gatekeep. It's to make sure you actually learned what you need to take care of patients. If you're doing the work, you'll pass.

## Clinical pearls (high yield)
- The Quick Reference Compendium alone is worth having open during every patient visit for the first 3-6 months of prescribing
- Chart note templates save 5-10 minutes per visit and improve documentation for insurance purposes
- The prior authorization appeal letter template has a success rate that's significantly higher than generic appeals

## Knowledge checks (with rationales)
1. **Question:** Which learning track is recommended for a provider who has been prescribing semaglutide for 6 months but wants to improve their practice systems and patient retention?
   - **Answer:** Practice Builder Track (Modules 0-8 + 10)
   - **Rationale:** This provider already has some clinical foundation but needs the operational framework (Module 10) and may have gaps in adverse effect management and monitoring that are affecting retention

2. **Question:** What is the minimum passing score on the final examination?
   - **Answer:** 80%
   - **Rationale:** The higher threshold for the comprehensive exam (vs 70% for module quizzes) ensures providers have integrated knowledge across all domains before completion

## Take-home summary (3 takeaways)
- Choose the learning track that fits your experience level. You can always come back and complete additional modules.
- The supplementary resources (quick reference, documentation templates, patient handouts) are as valuable as the videos for daily practice
- Assessments are designed to confirm practical competence, not trick you. Do the work and you'll pass.
