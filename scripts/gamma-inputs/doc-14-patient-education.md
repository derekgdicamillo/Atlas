# How to Give Your Weekly Injection

## Your Medication
**Name:** ________________________________
**Dose:** ________________________________
**Day of the week you inject:** ________________________________

---

## Before You Start

### What You Need
- Your medication pen
- Alcohol swab
- Sharps container (for used pens)

### Check Your Pen
- ✅ Check the expiration date
- ✅ Look at the medication — it should be clear and colorless
- ❌ Don't use if cloudy, discolored, or has particles

### Storage Reminders
- **Before first use:** Keep in the refrigerator (not the freezer)
- **After first use:** Can stay at room temperature for up to 4 weeks
- **Never freeze** your medication

---

## Step-by-Step Injection Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your Injection Site

You can inject in THREE areas:
1. **Belly (abdomen)** — most common
   - Stay at least 2 inches away from your belly button
2. **Front of your thigh**
3. **Back of your upper arm** (you may need help)

**Important:** Use a DIFFERENT spot each week. Don't inject in the exact same place twice in a row.

---

### Step 2: Clean the Area

- Wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab
- Let it air dry (don't blow on it)

---

### Step 3: Prepare the Pen

- Remove the pen cap
- Check that medication is visible in the window
- **For dial pens (Ozempic):** Turn the dial to your prescribed dose
- **For fixed-dose pens (Wegovy, Zepbound):** The dose is pre-set — no dialing needed

---

### Step 4: Give the Injection

1. **Hold the pen** like a pencil or dart
2. **Insert the needle** straight into your skin at a 90-degree angle (straight up and down)
3. **Press the button** all the way down
4. **Keep holding** for 5-10 seconds (count slowly!)
   - You may hear a click
   - Wait until the dose counter shows "0" or the window is empty
5. **Remove the needle** straight out
6. **Let go** of the skin

**That's it!** You did it. ✅

---

### Step 5: Dispose of the Pen

- Put the used pen in a sharps container
- Don't throw it in the regular trash
- Don't try to reuse pens

---

## Tips for Success

### Make It Easier
- 💡 Pick the same day and time each week (set a phone reminder!)
- 💡 Let the pen sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before injecting (feels more comfortable)
- 💡 Ice the area for 1-2 minutes before if you're nervous about the needle
- 💡 The needle is very small — most people say it doesn't hurt much

### Rotate Your Sites
Week 1: Right side of belly
Week 2: Left side of belly
Week 3: Right thigh
Week 4: Left thigh
(Then repeat)

---

## What If...

### The medication leaks out?
- This can happen if you don't hold the pen in place long enough
- Next time, count to 10 slowly after pressing the button

### I see a little blood or bruise?
- This is normal and harmless
- Apply gentle pressure with a cotton ball

### I forget my injection day?
- **If it's been less than 2 days:** Take it as soon as you remember, then continue your regular day
- **If it's been more than 2 days:** Skip that dose and take the next one on your regular day
- **Never take two doses in the same week**

### I'm traveling?
- Pack your medication in a carry-on bag with an ice pack
- Keep it cool but don't freeze it
- TSA allows injectable medications — bring your prescription label

---

## When to Call Your Doctor

Call us if you have:
- ❗ Severe pain at the injection site
- ❗ Signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus)
- ❗ Allergic reaction (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
- ❗ Questions about your dose or technique

# Eating for Success on Your GLP-1 Medication

Your medication helps reduce your appetite, but **what you eat** still matters a lot. This guide will help you lose fat (not muscle) and feel your best.

---

## The 4 Keys to Success

### 1. 🥩 Prioritize Protein

**Why it matters:**
- Protects your muscles during weight loss
- Keeps you feeling full longer
- Helps your body burn fat, not muscle

**How much:** Aim for **[60-100] grams of protein per day** (your provider will give you a specific goal)

**Protein-rich foods:**
| Food | Protein |
|------|---------|
| Chicken breast (4 oz) | 35g |
| Greek yogurt (1 cup) | 15-20g |
| Eggs (2 large) | 12g |
| Fish/shrimp (4 oz) | 25-30g |
| Cottage cheese (1 cup) | 25g |
| Lean beef (4 oz) | 30g |
| Protein shake | 20-30g |
| Tofu (1/2 cup) | 10g |

**Tips:**
- Eat protein at **every meal**
- Start your meal with protein before other foods
- Consider a protein shake if struggling to eat enough

---

### 2. 💧 Stay Hydrated

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents dehydration (especially important if you have nausea or diarrhea)
- Helps with constipation
- Supports your metabolism

**How much:** At least **64 ounces (8 cups) per day** — more if you're active or having GI symptoms

**What counts:**
- ✅ Water (best choice)
- ✅ Unsweetened tea or coffee
- ✅ Sparkling water
- ✅ Sugar-free drinks
- ⚠️ Broth/soup (counts but watch sodium)

**What doesn't count:**
- ❌ Alcohol
- ❌ Sugary drinks

**Tips:**
- Carry a water bottle everywhere
- Drink small sips throughout the day
- Set reminders on your phone

---

### 3. 🍽️ Eat Smaller Meals

**Why it matters:**
- Your stomach empties more slowly on this medication
- Large meals can cause nausea, bloating, and discomfort
- Smaller portions are easier to digest

**How to do it:**
- Eat **5-6 small meals** instead of 2-3 big ones
- Use a smaller plate
- Stop eating when you feel **satisfied, not stuffed**
- It's okay to leave food on your plate

**Sample meal sizes:**
- 3-4 oz protein (size of a deck of cards)
- 1/2 cup vegetables
- 1/4 cup starch (if eating carbs)

---

### 4. 🚫 Avoid Trigger Foods

**Foods that make side effects worse:**

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Fried foods | Slow digestion, worsen nausea |
| Greasy/fatty foods | Hard to digest, cause discomfort |
| Large portions | Overwhelm your slower-moving stomach |
| Very spicy foods | Can irritate your stomach |
| Carbonated drinks | May cause bloating (some people tolerate these) |
| Sugar alcohols (sorbitol, etc.) | Can cause diarrhea |

**Foods that help:**
| Choose | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Lean proteins | Easy to digest, protect muscle |
| Cooked vegetables | Gentler than raw |
| Bland foods (when nauseous) | Crackers, toast, rice, bananas |
| Ginger | May help with nausea (tea, candies, chews) |

---

## Sample Day of Eating

### Breakfast
- 2 scrambled eggs (12g protein)
- 1/2 cup cottage cheese (12g protein)
- Small piece of fruit

### Mid-Morning Snack
- Greek yogurt (15g protein)
- Small handful of nuts

### Lunch
- 4 oz grilled chicken (35g protein)
- Side salad with light dressing
- 1/2 cup roasted vegetables

### Afternoon Snack
- Protein shake (25g protein)
- Or cheese stick + apple slices

### Dinner
- 4 oz fish or lean meat (25-30g protein)
- Steamed vegetables
- Small portion of rice or potato (optional)

**Total protein: ~100g+**

---

## Managing Common Issues

### If you're nauseous:
- Eat bland foods (crackers, toast, rice, bananas)
- Avoid strong smells
- Eat slowly
- Don't lie down right after eating
- Try ginger tea or ginger candies

### If you're constipated:
- Drink more water
- Add fiber gradually (vegetables, fruits)
- Try MiraLAX if needed (ask your provider)
- Stay active — even walking helps

### If you have diarrhea:
- Stay hydrated (water, Gatorade, broth)
- Eat bland foods temporarily
- Avoid artificial sweeteners
- Imodium is okay to use if needed

### If you're not hungry at all:
- Still eat something! Your body needs nutrition
- Focus on protein first
- Protein shakes can help when solid food is unappealing
- Set meal reminders

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't skip meals** — your body needs nutrition, even if you're not hungry
❌ **Don't eat fast food regularly** — high fat content makes side effects worse
❌ **Don't forget protein** — you'll lose muscle instead of just fat
❌ **Don't drink alcohol excessively** — can worsen nausea and provides empty calories
❌ **Don't let yourself get dehydrated** — especially if having GI symptoms

---

## Track Your Progress

Consider tracking:
- Daily protein intake (apps: MyFitnessPal, Cronometer)
- Water intake
- How you feel after meals
- Weekly weight (same day, same time)

---

## Questions?

Talk to your provider about:
- Your specific protein goal
- Referral to a dietitian
- Vitamin/mineral supplements (if eating much less)

**Practice:** ________________________________
**Phone:** ________________________________

*Remember: This medication is a tool — healthy eating makes it work even better!*

# Managing Side Effects on Your GLP-1 Medication

Side effects are common, especially when you start or increase your dose. The good news: **they usually get better with time.** This guide tells you what to expect and what to do.

---

# What to Expect on Your Weight Loss Journey

Congratulations on taking this step! This guide will help you understand what to expect as you start your weight loss medication.

---

## How This Medication Works

Your medication is called a **GLP-1 receptor agonist** (or a similar type called a dual agonist). Here's what it does:

🧠 **Reduces your appetite** — You'll feel less hungry and get full faster
🍽️ **Slows digestion** — Food stays in your stomach longer, keeping you satisfied
🩸 **Helps blood sugar** — Works with your body's natural hormones
❤️ **May protect your heart** — Some of these medications reduce heart disease risk

**What it's NOT:** This is not a "magic pill." It's a tool that works best when combined with healthy eating and activity.

---

## What Results Can You Expect?

### Average Weight Loss
Based on clinical studies:

| Medication | Average Weight Loss |
|------------|---------------------|
| Semaglutide (Wegovy) | ~15% of body weight |
| Tirzepatide (Zepbound) | ~20% of body weight |

**For example:** If you weigh 250 lbs:
- 15% = about 37 lbs
- 20% = about 50 lbs

### Results Vary
- Some people lose more, some lose less
- Your personal results depend on many factors
- **Focus on YOUR progress, not comparing to others**

### Timeline
| Timeframe | What to Expect |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weeks 1-4 | Starting dose; getting used to medication; may have some side effects |
| Months 1-3 | Dose increasing; appetite decreasing; weight loss beginning |
| Months 3-6 | Often the fastest weight loss period |
| Months 6-12 | Weight loss may slow down; this is normal |
| Year 1+ | Maintenance phase; keeping the weight off |

---

## The Dose Escalation Schedule

You'll start on a **low dose** and gradually increase. This helps your body adjust and reduces side effects.

**Typical schedule (your provider will confirm your specific plan):**
- Start low
- Increase every 4 weeks
- Reach your maintenance dose in about 4-5 months

**Why go slow?**
- Reduces nausea and stomach upset
- Gives your body time to adjust
- Helps you stay on the medication long-term

---

## This Is a Long-Term Treatment

### Important to Understand
- **Obesity is a chronic condition** — like high blood pressure or diabetes
- **This medication treats the condition** — it's not a short-term fix
- **Stopping the medication usually leads to weight regain** — studies show most people regain weight if they stop

### What This Means for You
- Plan to stay on this medication long-term
- Think of it like blood pressure medication — you wouldn't stop taking that when your BP is controlled
- We'll work together to find the right maintenance plan for you

---

## Beyond the Scale: Other Benefits

Weight loss is just one measure of success. Watch for these improvements too:

✅ **More energy**
✅ **Better sleep** (especially if you have sleep apnea)
✅ **Less joint pain**
✅ **Better blood pressure**
✅ **Improved blood sugar** (if you have diabetes)
✅ **Better cholesterol numbers**
✅ **Clothes fitting better**
✅ **Improved mood and confidence**
✅ **Easier mobility** (walking, stairs, etc.)
✅ **Reduced or eliminated medications**

**We call these "non-scale victories" — and they matter just as much as the number on the scale!**

---

## What You Need to Do

This medication works best when you also:

### 1. Eat Well
- **Prioritize protein** (protects your muscles)
- **Stay hydrated** (at least 8 glasses of water daily)
- **Eat smaller meals** (your stomach will feel full faster)
- **Avoid greasy, fatty foods** (they make side effects worse)

### 2. Stay Active
- Any movement helps!
- Walking is great
- **Strength training** is especially important (protects muscle)
- Start where you are; gradually increase

### 3. Come to Your Appointments
- We need to monitor your progress
- Adjust your dose as needed
- Check labs periodically
- Celebrate your wins!

### 4. Communicate With Us
- Tell us about side effects
- Ask questions
- Share your concerns
- Report any problems

---

## Dealing with Plateaus

### What is a Plateau?
A plateau is when your weight stays the same for several weeks, even though you're doing everything right.

### Why Plateaus Happen
- Your body is adjusting to your new weight
- Completely normal and expected
- Does NOT mean the medication stopped working

### What to Do
- **Don't panic** — this is normal
- **Keep going** — stick with your plan
- **Focus on non-scale victories** — measurements, energy, how clothes fit
- **Talk to us** — we can help troubleshoot if needed

---

## Your Support Team

You're not alone on this journey. Your team may include:

- **Your prescribing provider** — manages your medication
- **Nurses/Medical assistants** — help with questions and refills
- **Dietitian** — helps with nutrition planning
- **Behavioral health** — supports emotional aspects of weight loss
- **Family and friends** — your personal support system

Don't hesitate to reach out when you need help!

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I drink alcohol?**
A: Alcohol is high in calories and can worsen nausea. Limit it, especially early on. If you have diabetes, alcohol can affect blood sugar.

**Q: What if I forget a dose?**
A: If less than 2 days late, take it right away. If more than 2 days late, skip it and take your next dose on schedule. Never take two doses in one week.

**Q: Will I need to take this forever?**
A: Most people benefit from long-term treatment. We'll work together to find the right plan for you.

**Q: What if I can't afford it?**
A: Ask us about savings cards and patient assistance programs. Many patients pay much less than the retail price.

**Q: Can I still eat my favorite foods?**
A: Yes, in moderation! This isn't about perfection. Focus on overall healthy patterns.
